Finding the best chocolate bars

Background
This competition is designed to help you get started with DataCamp Competitions and familiarize yourself with how competitions work. You work at a specialty foods import company that wants to expand into gourmet chocolate bars. Your boss needs your team to research this market to inform your initial approach to potential suppliers. After finding valuable chocolate bar ratings online, you need to explore if the chocolate bars with the highest ratings share any characteristics that could help you narrow your search for suppliers (e.g., cacao percentage, bean country of origin, etc.)

Your challenge
Create a report to summarize your research. Include:

What is the average rating by country of origin?
How many bars were reviewed for each of those countries?
Create plots to visualize findings for questions 1 and 2.
Is the cacao bean's origin an indicator of quality?
[Optional] How does cocoa content relate to rating? What is the average cocoa content for bars with higher ratings (above 3.5)?
[Optional 2] Your research indicates that some consumers want to avoid bars with lecithin. Compare the average rating of bars with and without lecithin (L in the ingredients).
Summarize your findings.
