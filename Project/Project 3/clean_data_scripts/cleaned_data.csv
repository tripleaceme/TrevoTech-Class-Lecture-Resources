"
190,5/7/22,9:56 PM , +234 816 484 7452, @2348108522573 I didn’t know MDS dates as far back as 2013
191,5/7/22,9:57 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Yes actually 

 
 MDS as a concept got launched with the advent of Cloud infrastructure with AWS in 2012
"
192,5/7/22,9:58 PM , +234 802 755 7589," @2348108522573 , check DM
"
193,5/7/22,9:58 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah
"
194,5/7/22,9:58 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Majority of the tools in the MDS stack were developed around that period. 
Looking at general adoption, the pace is slow
 
 But it got a wide adoption in 2016 with dbt
"
195,5/7/22,9:59 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Now that Knowledge Graphs are out there, it would take another 6"
196,5/7/22,10:00 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Like Graphical SQLs?
"
197,5/7/22,10:00 PM , +234 816 484 7452," It’s beyond that actually
"
198,5/7/22,10:00 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Be like say I don snooze
"
199,5/7/22,10:01 PM , +234 816 484 7452," It is defining the scope of a business as a Graph with intelligence in it.

 Why because it is easier to transverse a typical graph database than the relational one.
 
 Instead of building normal data models, you build graph data models and graph schemas.
"
200,5/7/22,10:02 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Companies making waves here that you can look at includes 

 RelationalAI, Neo4J and TigerGraph
"
201,5/7/22,10:02 PM , +234 708 145 1890," At least I know the last 2.
"
202,5/7/22,10:03 PM , +234 802 755 7589," This time last year, I never even know wetin be dbt much less the concept MDS.
"
203,5/7/22,10:03 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Never knew it had transcended to this.

 Woow... I knew Graphical Databases had so much potential, but it would be late before it comes to Nigeria.
"
204,5/7/22,10:04 PM , +234 708 145 1890," hardly see anyone skilled in Neo4J.

"
209,5/7/22,10:09 PM , +234 816 484 7452," It is in Nigeria already
Some companies who operate with Silicon Valley standards are already using Graph databases and some have knowledge Graphs already but not on a large scale
 
 I know one person here who has the skill
"
210,5/7/22,10:09 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah
"
211,5/7/22,10:09 PM , +234 816 484 7452," As in

 I believe oo... I just don't believe in Management in Nigeria.
"
213,5/7/22,10:10 PM , +234 816 484 7452," He doesn’t know that it is because the knowledge and skill is scarce or rather business haven”t really thought of exploring that area properly
"
214,5/7/22,10:10 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Who am I? Wetin I sabi 😅
"
215,5/7/22,10:10 PM , +234 816 484 7452," It’s like now in the Data space . 

 Everybody is either implementing a Data warehouse or a Data Lake here in Nigeria
"
216,5/7/22,10:11 PM , +234 703 954 3297," Thanks
"
217,5/7/22,10:11 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Exactly my point.

 If Businesses realised the potential of Knowledge Graphs, people would have been learning it.
"
218,5/7/22,10:11 PM , +234 816 484 7452," But Lakehouse Implementation is scare out here in Nigeria because we have this mentality that you need the Databricks environment to get it right
"
219,5/7/22,10:12 PM , +234 708 145 1890," @2348164847452, I remember talking to Sir Eddie that I wanted to pick up Graph Database when I first heard of it while doing ABDA.

 But no motivation, naso I drop am.

"
222,5/7/22,10:13 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Businesses see the use of dbt and MDS, that's why we have Analytics Engineering here.
"
223,5/7/22,10:13 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Some top officials in some foreign companies have turned to it sef for personal project and they are ready to pay big for it if you can work for them on it

 So na MSC and PhD students go gain if they find themselves in that environment
"
224,5/7/22,10:14 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Because no one is doing it here
"
225,5/7/22,10:14 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah
"
226,5/7/22,10:15 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Even some companies see DE as basically SSIS, Talend and Informatica. 
But that’s because of the special publicity and evangelism @2348108522573 did oo
 
 It’s recently that a few cloud tools started coming up like ADF etc.
"
227,5/7/22,10:16 PM , +234 708 145 1890," ADF 😍

 Na @2347060577846 make me like Microsoft ehn.

"
229,5/7/22,10:17 PM , +234 816 484 7452," I would just say it’s okay for every Data team to have their own R&D faction

 It would really help them a lot
"
230,5/7/22,10:18 PM , +234 816 484 7452," @2348108522573  AE started as R&D 
"
231,5/7/22,10:18 PM , +234 703 952 6987," <Media omitted>
"
232,5/7/22,10:20 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," It’s of recent bro o. 
There was a big problem, countless nights of research
 
 By this time last year nothing like AE or dbt or MDS in this space o atleast to the best of my knowledge I may be wrong. 
 
 
 It basically stem up from a major issue we had here. Many DS or DA folks joining a company and end of doing Data engineering or infrastructure work cos data not available. 
 
 My diving into AE was a need I probably wouldn’t have if there was an infrastructure available and I start building the ML model I was recruited for to do 😂. 
 
 I end up building infrastructure. My discovering AE was research actually when I was at that cross road of deliver value or lose your job 😂
"
233,5/7/22,10:20 PM , +234 708 145 1890," My Boss and I were still talking about it.

 How many companies even have R&D, not to talk of Data R & D.
"
234,5/7/22,10:21 PM , +234 708 145 1890," 👌🏾

 Beautiful...
"
235,5/7/22,10:21 PM , +234 816 484 7452," It’s research actually

 You want to have a good Data team. Have problems that put them to research

 Power Platform Boss. Welcome.
"
241,5/7/22,10:28 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Many medium to large companies in Nigeria are Microsoft dominated and still use onprem tools like SSIS. This will likely shift over the next 2 to 3 years as companies migrate to cloud and adopt a hybrid approach and later fully cloud approach. The story for startups and newer business es is different. They can go fully cloud from day 1
"
242,5/7/22,10:29 PM , +234 708 145 1890," IKR... It's totally cheaper for them.

 Microsoft is doing great never the less. And they aren't backing down, they are ready for when Businesses decide to go cloud.
"
243,5/7/22,10:29 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Making it easy to integrate what you already have with Cloud.
"
244,5/7/22,10:29 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Even with LowCode/NoCode.
"
245,5/7/22,10:31 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah exactly,
"
246,5/7/22,10:31 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Microsoft will win the medium to large organisstions cloud market in Nigeria. It is easy for them to transition to cloud that way. However, doubt they will win the start up and newer business market here. It will likely be an AWS, GCP play.
"
247,5/7/22,10:32 PM , +234 816 484 7452," We would preach the Gospel of Building Lakehouses with Azure Databricks Environment
"
248,5/7/22,10:32 PM , +234 816 484 7452," To the startup Guys
"
249,5/7/22,10:32 PM , +234 708 145 1890," You can count the number of companies that would agree to use Open Source.
I also have to preach the Microsoft Gospel 😅 but we could replace SSIS workflows with better optimized open source pipelines that would do better.
 
 Definitely not banks (which are one of the largest data store houses in Nigeria).
"
250,5/7/22,10:33 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Lol 😂🤣

253,5/7/22,10:33 PM , +234 708 145 1890," 😅
That’s why there are paid and optimized versions of the Open source tools for them
 
 Preach it sir. 🙌🏾
 I kuku have experience of drawing architectural diagrams and pitching to management.
"
254,5/7/22,10:34 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I created this some months back to summarize the ecosystem. Because data professionals need to consider this during their learning journey

255,5/7/22,10:34 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Honestly, Boss Ayodele did great with this diagram.

 Much respect.
"
256,5/7/22,10:34 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Delta Lake and Apache Spark are open source but there is the Azure Databricks Runtime environment with 10x optimized Spark versions for implementing your Lakehouses
"
257,5/7/22,10:34 PM , +234 802 755 7589," @2348108522573, I see business opportunities; should they be ready.

"
259,5/7/22,10:35 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," It’s not that easy actually as @2348180472075 said. 

 I think we had this conversation too last month. Regulation and a whole lot of stuff limit companies from adopting cloud even though it’s better and way better but like boss @2348180472075  with time they will come to see that they can’t run from it.
"
260,5/7/22,10:35 PM , +234 802 755 7589," I no see AE oh🤔
"
261,5/7/22,10:36 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah this makes sense but I don’t see tools or technology like Airflow or RPA technology in any of the bucket

 I guess we can just put them all under python
"
262,5/7/22,10:36 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," The tool stack are there. 

 More around skills to learn to target startup and international companies based on your learning goals.

"
283,5/7/22,10:42 PM , +234 816 484 7452," DE and DA needs Spark too. But this depends on the companies environment 

 And you didn’t add Airbnb Apache Superset which is a major BI tool like metabase and the powerbi out there with even more complexities
"
284,5/7/22,10:42 PM , +234 708 145 1890," People that don't type code.

 I guess.

299,5/7/22,10:50 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Now they are talking about Unbundling BI with MDS which Dagster is trying to achieve
"
300,5/7/22,10:50 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Low code analysts or data scientists.  Typically business users who are tech savvy but not too technical

 You may choose to study with a partner University or unicaf university itself.
 
 But tutorials is actually handled by unicaf, not the partner uni. They also supply the study material.
 
 
 Another option is to use Stafford Global (Google it).
 
 Edx has a few schools offering scholarships for MSc too now.

 But there's another school that has an Analytics Masters for USD 10k on Edx too.
"
441,5/8/22,10:42 AM , +234 903 783 8682," USD10k is a lot of money, at least for me.

 Unicaf courses are GPD3k if you're paying in installments. And even lesser if you're paying once.
 
 Also, these edX universities usually require TOEFL, Gre and all sorts of English tests.
 
 But I think Unicaf will only request for your WAEC English and maybe any English electives you did in undergrad.
"
442,5/8/22,10:53 AM , +234 909 130 5248," We do this in my own company
"
443,5/8/22,10:53 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Edx don't all require GRE though.

 Like I said the major difference between both is that with Edx universities, the institutions are whom you'll directly interface with. Lessons from them. Study materials from them etc.
 
 With unicaf, the partner institution is really just a partner. They'll share their syllabus, but unicaf handles the lessons, learning materials etc.
 The Partner uni just gives you a certificate after everything.
"
444,5/8/22,10:56 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Difference will be in the quality of the Learning.

 But if certificate is your major interest, then unicaf is aite.

449,5/8/22,12:18 PM , +234 818 047 2075," This is why data quality checks and data observability are now critical and getting more attention these days. Business users shouldn't be telling me numbers are wrong before I know that my pipelines have beans
"
450,5/8/22,12:19 PM , +234 810 612 9023," Speaking of this btw, do you have a tool you use for data quality checks? Asides from, say, Great Expectations?
"
451,5/8/22,12:19 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Pipelines get beans 😂😂😂
"
452,5/8/22,12:19 PM , +234 810 612 9023," It's something I've been looking into lately
"
453,5/8/22,12:20 PM , +234 818 047 2075," The best approach is to get quality and observability systems that make the team more proactive but they are expensive >20k.
"
454,5/8/22,12:20 PM , +234 810 612 9023," Especially around comparing source and destination systems
"
455,5/8/22,12:20 PM , +234 810 612 9023," At least one that isn't built on dbt. Most of them seem to be these days
"
456,5/8/22,12:20 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Plan to get a data catalog with these capabilities hopefully this year. But those things are expensive for most Nigerian companies
"
457,5/8/22,12:20 PM , +234 816 484 7452," I think I can fetch a couple of tools you can look at but I would have to check my archive
"
458,5/8/22,12:21 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Great expectations is a good one but you will just have to do a lot of ground work
"
459,5/8/22,12:21 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Great expectation 

 And you can explore Data Catalogue & Observatility like Monte carlo
"
460,5/8/22,12:21 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Atlan and Great expectations are good one to check out
"
461,5/8/22,12:21 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Yeah Monte carlo, Soda, Atlan, Alation, Ovaledge
"
462,5/8/22,12:21 PM , +234 816 484 7452," But the tools o mostly know are open source

"
464,5/8/22,12:21 PM , +234 818 047 2075," There are quite a number but they are expensive for a number of companies
"
465,5/8/22,12:22 PM , +234 810 612 9023," I tried to integrate Great Expectations in our Airflow Workflow, but it's currently unsatisfactory for our use case
"
466,5/8/22,12:22 PM , +234 810 612 9023," Yeah, pricing can be quite an issue actually
"
467,5/8/22,12:22 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," What’s your use case??
"
468,5/8/22,12:23 PM , +234 810 612 9023," I was on a call with Bigeye a few weeks back, great product, but pricing is a bit high
"
469,5/8/22,12:24 PM , +234 818 047 2075," We built business rules in python it gave more flexibility. We have integrated output with PowerBi to monitor critical fields. But that is our temporary solution till we get a proper tool
"
470,5/8/22,12:24 PM , +234 818 047 2075," What we have done just addresses quality not observibility
"
471,5/8/22,12:25 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Pricing is actually crazy with lot of service products
"
472,5/8/22,12:25 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Been in talks with Ovaledge. They are the cheapest I have seen and even that it is >15k
"
473,5/8/22,12:26 PM , +234 810 612 9023," So we need to validate destination systems against source systems. Great expectations seem to validate against the metrics you specify just on the data itself. Also doesn't give as much observability, except maybe  causing the pipelines to fail when used with Airflow
"
474,5/8/22,12:26 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," What one of our client did is to integrate dbt/Great expectation to monitor and track pipeline state embedded with Airflow.
"
475,5/8/22,12:27 PM , +234 816 484 7452," I think I found it 
"
476,5/8/22,12:27 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I think great expectations addresses data quality not sure it does observibility

"
480,5/8/22,12:28 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Yeah 

 They layered dbt logs with Datafold
"
481,5/8/22,12:28 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Datafold is also a great tool.
"
482,5/8/22,12:29 PM , +234 818 047 2075," For us it is temporary till we get a tool. It was an urgent project, so we had to do something. You can check ovaledge out. See if it meets your needs
"
483,5/8/22,12:29 PM , +234 810 612 9023, dbt is quite central to most open
484,5/8/22,12:30 PM , +234 810 612 9023," Ok, I'll check it out. Thanks
"
485,5/8/22,12:30 PM , +234 816 484 7452," I personally believe that , what you would use for data quality and observability depends largely on your environment and team stack right now
"
486,5/8/22,12:31 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Thanks for this 🙏
"
487,5/8/22,12:32 PM , +234 816 484 7452," On our end for data quality checks, we use out of the box delta lake logs  and lakeFS CI/CD hooks for approval for the data that goes from DEV environment to PRD
"
488,5/8/22,12:33 PM , +234 810 612 9023," Thing is, we haven't adopted dbt in our Airflow workflow yet. Matter of fact, we just got started with Airflow in February, and only have just the initial set of jobs up.
"
489,5/8/22,12:33 PM , +234 816 484 7452," If you don’t want to a lot of coding to implement these things, you just have to pay for premium environnement where you can just call these things

Ayo is so nice to summarize 🤣😂
 
 Hence why a school of thoughts believe meta data should be driving Data infrastructure and pipeline to make it easy to fix any pipeline that breaks because proper data governance and definition have been done. So it will be easy to know where to look it any numbers doesn’t add up

 I will advise that one starts with ML or BI in the early days and then over time pick up some data management knowledge. There is currently no path (that i am aware of) that allows people start off with data management. For example, I started learning about data management around this time last year while interviewing for my current role. Prior to that time it was mostly ML and BI
"
545,5/8/22,1:57 PM , +234 703 954 3297," Thanks for the info
"
546,5/8/22,1:59 PM , +234 816 484 7452," True and very correct bu there will be exceptions for DE guys to know at least something on Data Management and Governance at the very least.

"
747,5/8/22,11:42 PM , +234 708 531 6273," For streaming

 You have to focus more on the kinesis family, SQS, SNS, Lambda, VPC, S3 , and Cloud watch... You will have to find resources that treat each of them thoroughly, especially those that use Python Boto3 to interact with the services.
 
 For Data warehousing and Data lake, your focus will be on
 Redshift, Athena, S3 and maybe glue.
 
 
 No matter which one you choose, you will also learn how to deploy them with Terraform, dockerize some of the services, write python, SQL and Spark.

753,5/8/22,11:51 PM , +234 708 531 6273," It is tricky. What you will end up doing depends on the company you later find yourself. 
If I want to advise someone looking into the Nigeria market, I will say data lake/warehousing and migration path.
 
 Redshift, Athena, glue , dbt, Airflow. If you have any Open Source ETL tool then you can ignore glue.

"

 Well, there's ~hope~ hold for the future 😅.
"
1052,5/9/22,3:39 PM , +234 703 806 5681," You can do that.

 But the interest on dollar mutual funds are typically lower (like 2.5% sometimes), with a longer holding period, and fewer payouts in between.
"
1053,5/9/22,3:41 PM , +234 703 806 5681," You can hold. But many Millennials and Gen Z got into stock and Crypto at the height of one of the greatest bull runs in history.

 The economy moves in cycles.
 
 We are likely heading towards a recession, like we had in 2008.
 
 
 For Diamond hands, that isn't a long wait.

 With this, I think I can hedge against currency devaluation.
 
 If Naira drops further in 5yrs (stats show devaluation rate of about 13.58% per annum).
 
 But like you said, the sweet spot is having a diversified portfolio.

 NLP/ Text Mining experts, does it make sense to build a classification model on classes generated from topic modelling? I don't know if I'm putting it right but here's what I mean.
 
 1. You apply topic modelling on a large data of text
 2. The original data would have a new column specify the topic class.
 3. From the topics generated, you apply some classification ML to get the probabilities of a document falling in each of the generated topics. 
 4. Then the model would be used to predict future data.
 
 Thanks.

 Project managers are worse. They won't let you talk. They'll go online and read all sorts of stuff and come and complicate simple things for the team. 
 
 That's why the best project managers are those that have technical background and later transitioned to project management. 
 
 I've met one before. He was such a wonderful person. 
 He will give you assignment and show you exactly how you'll solve the problem. You'll grow when you work with people like them. 
 
 It's a pity that they're few especially in Nigeria where tech is still relatively young. I hope we all grow to become people like that for the future generation.

 One of the major reasons is basically how they treat Dashboard like a software and not just a report. So you can apply software engineering principles (version controlling , testing, CI/CD etc.), and the semantic layer built on LookML really help makes the life of business user easy once the developer build the necessary explore that can interact with, so they don’t need to learn anything technical to use it

You might spend so much time trying to optimize a model that cannot be improved further simply because the topic modeling was probably not done right. Basically, you’d be transferring errors from the topic modeling into the model you’re building as well as topic modeling also isn’t 100% right. A model is as good as the quality of data used to train it.

 The goal is to classify an activity description based on common themes/topics.
 
 For example, if an activity description is describing a charity event or humanitarian event or something, the model would be able to somehow know..

But this has worked many times.
 
 Use latent dirichlet allocation model
 
 Test whether the distribution per activity description of hidden semantic information could predict the classes (charity or humanitarian etc)
 
 Since the data is about <10^5; Train LDA Model on about 75% of the activity description (randomized sample).
 
 Grab Topic distributions for every activity description using the LDA Model
 
 
 Use the same LDA model(same hyperparameters) to get topic distributions for other 30% (unseen data)
 
 Run supervised classification models again on the 30% vectors and see if this generalizes.

 Using the Power BI Client would mean, you have to do your dashboard first.
 
 If you are comfortable with codes, you wouldn't bother. But someone that's an expert with Power Bi might favour this route.

1382,5/10/22,1:39 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Well depending on the spectrum of analytics you are playing will determine if you need Business Acumen, Communication and all.

"
1384,5/10/22,1:42 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," If you more upstream to the infrastructure side of things you may not need have need to interact with stakeholders unless you are a Lead or Manager, but folks that are downstream who will interact with the business and stakeholders sure need to have good communication skills and Business Acumen.
"

1389,5/10/22,1:48 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," For me 1,2&5 is the most difficult in my current role because code can be gotten off the internet with proper GOOGLING , but how do I understand a business process in a short time, understand stakeholders need then try come up with a solution approach (Problem solving).
"
1390,5/10/22,1:54 PM , +234 818 047 2075," 3, 4 and 5 are super important especially because i think we need to talk about it more. 

 For 3, it is super important because the aesthetics of a dashboard is what grabs the users attention.
  
 For 4, succes of your projects depend on this. Manage stakeholders closely from requirement gathering to delivery and monitoring adoption. As you go higher, it becomes even more critical.
 
 For 5, understanding the business is also important because it helps you promise initiatives and also helps you deliver initiatives that the business will find useful

"
1394,5/10/22,1:59 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I think every data professional will have to. If we think about the business and IT as stakeholders then yes. To your point DE will most likely interact more with IT and a little with the business. For every other person, it is probably the opposite.
"
1395,5/10/22,2:00 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," For 3 it’s funnily many of the dashboards I have seen across many of my clients aren’t aesthetic like that 😃 but just simple dashboard capture the right metrics they need.

 I don’t know maybe they aren’t interested in all those stunning dashboards we see people publish as side projects 😂😂

 Your problem solving skill depends on your understanding of the business which determines the flow of your analysis and visualization.
 
 Communicating to stakeholders depends on your viz..
"
1406,5/10/22,2:05 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Not clear
"
1407,5/10/22,2:07 PM , S+N Ayoade," Exactly!
"
1408,5/10/22,2:07 PM , +234 803 353 6901," Like a case study questions of what the stakeholders wants to do
"
1409,5/10/22,2:07 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Communication to stakeholders don’t necessarily depend on viz. Your viz will depend on the business requirements you have gathered. So communication in this instance will be multifaceted just as @2348180472075 explained. 

 If you don’t know how to manage their expectations and gather requirements well you are in for a difficult ride.
"
1410,5/10/22,2:08 PM , +234 803 353 6901," The last line 😭😭😭
"
1411,5/10/22,2:08 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Nah. 

 Many time your case study and initiative you will propose will be dependent on your communication with stakeholders to understand their needs.
"
1412,5/10/22,2:08 PM , +234 803 353 6901," It will be difficult

 Like you don't want to interactive or sorts. You just want to view everything at a glance.
 
 What's now the purpose of having interactive dashboards. We for just dey use Excel then.
 
 Stakeholders can be difficult at times. But na my job be that, handle stakeholders.

"
1502,5/10/22,3:44 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Yes true, I think organisations try to fix bad data with the limited info they have but they don't do it with governance or data management principles. So usually the fixes are temporary. E.g. doing a data clean up without fixing the source of quality issues. 

 What needs to happen is an awareness of data management principles. DAMAs DMBOK is a good one. This will guide them in going about it the right way.

 All columns on the left table(Loan) will be returned regardless of whether a row from the left table has a matching row from the right table(User).
 
 If there is no match, the columns from the right table(Users) will contain NULL.
 
 
 
 In summary, if the loan id has no users, the values in the first name and last name are NULL.

 If you don't want to manage your own portfolio, then they're worth giving a trial.
 
 Alternatively, you can just invest in ETFs by yourself.

"
2087,5/12/22,9:12 AM , +234 813 312 7971," From my experience of trading crypto coins and investing in stocks… they’re different 

 
 Crypto coin crash is way crazier, a coin can dip and never recover.
 
 Plus I don’t hold in a very unstable condition….
 
 If you’ve been following the crypto market well, you’ll understand the uncertainty in it.
 
 Sometimes not trading or holding gives a better ROI.

Thank you for giving a better context
 
 Sometimes it’s better to just trade/hold short time.
 
 Also, have a trading strategy, a 10% or 15% monthly is not bad.
 
 I don’t even buy coins unless there’s a crazy dip. 
 
 Overtime when you lose money, you’ll know what works for you.

"

"
2248,5/12/22,7:05 PM , +234 816 484 7452," So remember for the data lake, remember I said that there are technologies people used to handle it flaws. 

 So in actual sense ehn,
 
 A LakeHouse is actually *Data Lake + Data Warehouse*
 
 *A lakehouse* builds upon the strength and flaws of these two technologies and concepts.
 
 So Ideally when you use Delta Lake to handle the flaws of a typical data lake, you are actually implementing a Lakehouse.
 
 The easiest way to implement the LakeHouse is by using *Databricks* environment out of the box with any of your cloud or object storage or any file system of your choice be it Hadoop FS, LakeFS or even minIO storage

 Lets me use something small, You are using Postgres for your data warehouse implementation, and your data size is like 100Gb but you know that you hardly query a large part of the data. What you can do here is to have your historical data in a Lakehouse or normal data in parquet format or delta table format hereby shrinking your 100Gb to about 25Gb in parquet but you connect your lakehouse to your Postgres using *parquet_fdw* , So that you can query your red hot data which can be around 5Gb on Postgres and from Postgres environment, you can query your historical data which is 25Gb in size from the data lake or lakehouse

2340,5/13/22,2:08 PM , +234 814 669 0593," Let me try and give a summary 

 Standard deviation is a measure of spread. It gives an idea of how close the data elements are to the central measure (mean, median and mode).  A measure of the stastical precision.
 
 So, in this case, you can use the spread to detect outliers or factor samples that disrupt the distribution. 
 
  For example,  you can decide to take only data that falls between one or standard deviation of the central measure.

There are tasks that are so repetitive that you copy basics scripts.
 
 For example,  NER layer is NER layer,  the architecture doesn't change.  It is what you feed it into that you start building.  But that first block , you don't need to rewrite

Companies are businesses, they don't care about the difficulty or technicality of your job. If you like use Excel or pandas they don't care as long as they're getting the result.

"
2585,5/14/22,10:59 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Performance tuning and optimization varies from db/DW you are using and how it is handled, and what I am looking at improving.

 For Bigquery I don’t need Indexiig I just need to Partition and Cluster my tables well based on how I need them to be queried faster. 
 
 For Redshift I can use Distkey/sort key, table compression or use concurrent scaling and elastic resize to handle huge workload. 
 
 I just started working on Snowflake and I believe it will have it own optimization technique

 SELECT distinct (category) will work but you don’t want to run that on a huge dataset because it’s not a well optimized query 😂, so you have to find a way to get same resume writing an optimized query. 
 
 You will start considering when when a query will do full scan of your dataset or just a partial or seek approach.

"
2609,5/14/22,11:18 AM , +234 703 316 7142," It depends on the the rate of reads on the table of interest. Indexes takes storage on its own and can be more than half the storage of data itself depending on columns you indexed.

For SQL server there is a major indexing tactic for scenarios like this. I would check if I can still get the piece I have on indexing techniques.
 
 But I know that, apart from code refactoring from source to report, 
 You can break the tables into smaller partitions. And index from source.
 
 Whereby all other tables and reporting views would come from that source .

Who here works as a Data person in a financial institution?
 Want to know the individual's experience working in a financial institution so I can mirror it in an application I want to submit.

If you are coming in as an entry level or Junior role then the fundamental DA skills should be what you should tailor your application to, but if you are coming in as experienced hire then an experience in the finance space will be required.

 I think the biggest career turnover in the data space happens in data science, unfortunately. And by ""data science"" here, I'm specifically referring to the typical scope of work of a ""data scientist"", because sometimes the term ""data science"" can refer to one entire side of the coin of the data space itself, the other side being data management/governance.
 
 Now, talking about turnover, I've seen that it can be hard to break into data science after the learning journey, even harder to succeed in the role, and hardest to sustain success and keep up the progression of career growth. 
 
 Most people give up at Stage 1. Stage 2 is where some others come to the objective realisation that data science isn't the best area for them to make impact with data. Stage 3 is where you see the rest of the pivot where people permanently ditch DS for other data areas such as DA or DE, or even completely outside such as product or engineering.
 
 I've been opportune to function across DA, DS, DE, sometimes focusing on one individual area and other times doing a combination, but I've spent the shortest time doing data engineering and the longest doing data science. In my experience across the 3 areas, it's easy to understand why data science gets the most turnover. Data science is the most hyped amongst all the data specialisations. And, if you ask me the hype is well worth it – data science literally sits at the center of decision optimisation and automation for orgs that are creating and monetising data value streams. 
 
 The problem with this hype is that the complexities are not presented well enough or even at all, so it typically sounds like you only need to learn coding (Python/R), a little bit of statistics, and then machine learning. So you get excited and learn these, then realise that with only these skills, you are just about the most useless DS professional in the competitive talent pool. You even find that your counterparts have additional tools in their stack (e.g., badass SQL, Spark, Kafka, Storm, SageMaker, etc). Now, you have a new motivation, so you throw in more tools to your learning curve.
 
 But all the while you have not learned or developed skills in the deep, intricate principles for driving business value with data science. You have not learned how to extend the capabilities of a data engineer and analyst to get additional business value that those areas alone cannot provide. Note the keyword"

2816,5/14/22,11:00 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Me the reason I am doing DE today sef was because I didn’t want to follow the crowd into data science when it started

2819,5/14/22,11:27 PM , Abraham Musa," I think the narrative over here is a bit structured and I think demand for *good data scientist* will continue to be on the rise. Like my team, we currently have five Data Scientist and a single analyst. Apart from myself 😀🤣, the other four guys are core scientist in every sense of it and they build DS products that positively impacts the business everyday. 

 The company has massive database and as a new joiner, I'm always surprised that when a new business problem arises, most discussions are geared towards building NNs. Even the graduate level Scientist has been trained to do madass stuffs.
"
2820,5/14/22,11:28 PM , Abraham Musa," Doing DS in naija can be very challenging. Even more challenging to build yourself to a world class level cos even the most advanced NG companies haven't really gotten to the point where they think they can leverage or benefit from DS.
"
2821,5/14/22,11:30 PM , Abraham Musa," Will I continue to be a DS in the near future? I can't completely say for now but one thing remains, Data Scientist or not, the key thing is to continously solve business problems and deliver value. While at that, good money must be made too.

 DE almost stole my heart in 2019 when I used GCP heavily, but I got bored honestly. I just knew that life wasn't for me, so stuck with DS
"
2824,5/14/22,11:51 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Okay, I will extend it then and make finishing touches

2829,5/15/22,12:06 AM , +234 904 894 6475," You nailed it! The ability to drive business value is what keeps one in demand. I was about to extend my earlier post by adding how data scientists can create business value using data science.
"
2830,5/15/22,12:18 AM , +234 904 894 6475," For example, in data science, the problems we solve typically revolve around causal inference, machine learning or decision optimisation. Some jobs might focus on only 1 or 2 of these areas. Now, applying any of these 3 scientific pillars to business problems presents us with 2 layers of difficulty. 

 
 Now, the second layer is the business layer, where the difficulty lies with aligning science to business. Science is mostly deterministic, business is mostly stochastic. Applying data science to business then means developing or implementing the specific principles of science that allow us to deal with the ""stochastic"" nature of a business landscape that is constantly ""changing"" with new ""data"". This is why data science is built on solid foundations of calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Notice the 3 things in quotes"

 I don’t have the strength for it.

2832,5/15/22,12:58 AM , +234 703 160 7868," Solid clarity of thought! This should be a medium post or a YDP blog post. I wanted like it multiple times if possible.
"
2833,5/15/22,1:18 AM , +234 813 774 1580," Well said.
"
2834,5/15/22,1:24 AM , +234 813 774 1580," Well said, the discussion is always deeper than it seems. In addition to that, its just like back in the days when it was believed that computers will take away bankers jobs but its only going to enhance their effectiveness and evolution. DS and AI can easily be misunderstand in similar fashion.

 If one wants to switch career, feel free to do that but don't do it because it is perceived that one is going into extinction. Till this day, the confusion is still there on who a DS is. As the world evolve, DS has grown into a role that requires some part of DE,  ML, and DA; its never just about building models or doing research because if it is then, most of that can be automated. DS will forever revolve around the business impact. While a senior DS may dish out data cleaning to a Junior DS, sometimes I will say that for a new domain where you must learn and understand the business, its better you do that yourself to help you understand the data more because that's where your creativity and curiosity begins and it will aid your discussion with stakeholders.
 Amazon  had a lot of open roles in the US for DS in 2022 alone. 
 Personally, I'm a crush of both DE, ML, and Data Product Manager. Remember, every data person out there is a product manager. This is not because I think DS is going into extinction but because that's where I love to be for now. @2347038065681 may host a show for us to discuss this😁

 One of the greatest ways to make impact with data is to treat it as a product, especially on the technical side. On the business side, data needs to be treated as a core business asset. Combine these 2 mindsets about data together, and an org will unleash enormous impact with their data value stream.

"
2869,5/15/22,11:17 AM , +234 703 678 8365," For example, when performing EDAs you really wouldn't want to go out of your current work environment(e.g Jupyter notebook) to do visuals with Power BI for every insight you come up with. Libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn as well as python help you with that on the go. A few lines of code can give you an overview Viz of your data rather that several clicks on Tableau and PowerBI. I really wouldn't want to go as far as applying statistical models and checking plots on the go as well.

 But I also think the industry itself has an impact. For example its easy to identify many DS use cases in financial services company than say a down stream oil and gas company.
 
 I think it is both, industry and data Maturity. Happy to hear your thoughts.
"
2888,5/15/22,2:00 PM , +234 818 047 2075," The downstream oil company will likely get more value from employing only a DE and DA than getting a DE, DA and DS. This is what I mean.
"
2889,5/15/22,2:08 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," It depends on the Data Maturity of the organization, and in all honesty and what I have seen many organizations will derive more value in just Descriptive/Diagnostic Analytics which can be achieved with the right infrastructure in place (Data Engineer terrain ) and a good Data Analyst exploring the data. 

 In Monica Hierachy of needs (AI & Advanced analytics) can only be realized when the pyramid based needs are in place which is where a company have a good data maturity. 
 
"
2890,5/15/22,2:14 PM , +234 909 130 5248," DS is something that is done later on

"
2892,5/15/22,2:18 PM , +234 904 894 6475," You are right boss. The industry too matters.

 For example, in the downstream sector, one area I can think of where machine learning becomes very useful is supply chain optimisation. Although I've not seen this in practice in 9ja. Other than this, one cannot think of many use cases for DS/ML in that sector.
"
2893,5/15/22,2:19 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," 💯 

 Thanks @2349048946475 for the detailed response.
"
2894,5/15/22,2:22 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Although I think one major problem with the downstream of and gas sector is untapped potential. So the problem is not that there are not many DS use cases that can scale, but that there's not so much tech adoption in several areas. And where the tech is not in place, data science cannot be brought in as a secondary lever.
"
2895,5/15/22,2:23 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Data Maturity is very very important and definitely industry. 

 Many organizations aren’t matured atleast yet to really support and drive DS use cases and that’s why the right Data Strategy just as @2349048946475 mentioned will also be required which comes with the maturity of the organization. 
 
 I believe we are getting there in Nigeria atleast for organizations who are aware of roles like CDO/Head of Data and all.

"
2900,5/15/22,2:27 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," And that’s what my company pitch to our client that becoming a Data driven organization is a journey
"
2901,5/15/22,2:27 PM , Abraham Musa," Even so called organizations hiring DS lead or the likes.
"
2902,5/15/22,2:29 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I 💯 understand you actually. 

 Becoming a Data driven organization is more driven from culture perspectives and not only from the technology side of things of hiring talents and all alone. 
 
 A lot of education need to be done across then organizations actually.
"
2903,5/15/22,2:32 PM , +234 904 894 6475," For example, if we begin to see the rise of apps and software products in the downstream sector, such as marketplace apps or apps that manage suppliers and documentation, then first of all we will see a rise of DA/DEs in that sector. 

 Then subsequently, data science needs will begin to arise, such as demand forecasting, optimising movement of products, optimising delivery speed, etc. These are use cases that can scale very well.

2943,5/15/22,2:52 PM , Abraham Musa," This is actually interesting one oooo. I hardly see people God lead to relocate, spend years working for global brands and come back to start building something in Naija. Just check LinkedIn and do some survey.
"
2944,5/15/22,2:53 PM , +234 904 894 6475," I used to be close to senior folks in that sector. The reason many of them would resist tech adoption is because they profit from the loopholes and inefficiencies in the sector. If you want to know what free lunch looks like, come downstream 🤣
"
2945,5/15/22,2:53 PM , +234 904 894 6475," 🤲🏽🤲🏽🤲🏽

"
2947,5/15/22,2:54 PM , Abraham Musa," Yeah. I also agree with this in a way. The question from me always is that how long will guys in the pipeline serve loyalty? I think the hussle today cuts across interns, junior, seniors and even managers in Naija oo.
"
2948,5/15/22,2:54 PM , +234 904 894 6475, A time will come when serious data
2949,5/15/22,2:54 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," 💯 

 Middle & Senior is where the challenge is actually.
"
2950,5/15/22,2:54 PM , +234 706 439 6712," _How of us are actually pinned and deliberate about  solving Nigerian 's problems using Data/I.T skills or we are largely , simply just  chasing the bag_?  🧐

 Can Innovation thrive hence?
"
2951,5/15/22,2:55 PM , +234 818 047 2075," The thing about catching them young is you probably still have them for 2 to 3 years post NYSC
"
2952,5/15/22,2:55 PM , +234 909 130 5248," Let the bag come first then we think about solving problems
"
2953,5/15/22,2:55 PM , Abraham Musa," I'm surprised sometimes you see a fresh out from school getting job with global brands like Microsoft, Google etc. Ifs really war
"
2954,5/15/22,2:55 PM , +234 909 130 5248," No problem solver solve problems on hunger
"
2955,5/15/22,2:56 PM , +234 706 439 6712," 🤣...  I like ur honesty
"
2956,5/15/22,2:56 PM , +234 706 439 6712," Exactly the point
"
2957,5/15/22,2:56 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I think that’s what Interswitch is trying to do now with their new program. 
"
2958,5/15/22,2:56 PM , Abraham Musa," Tbh,  I would argue that most of us are chasing the bag boss.
"
2959,5/15/22,2:56 PM , +234 904 894 6475," <Media omitted>
"
2960,5/15/22,3:00 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Exactly. What will even be better is to try to train them from say 200L. Imagine a 200L student joining YDP today. By final year, the guy probably has a good grasp of the space and can deliver projects. So his NYSC, he isn't coming in as a fresher but experienced.
"
2961,5/15/22,3:01 PM , +234 818 047 2075," This isn't such a bad thing because it is then easier to fund initiatives that are solving the real problems.
"
2962,5/15/22,3:02 PM , +234 706 439 6712," Exactly. 

 
 And my worry is that , even when we get the bag and things begin to a get bit ""rosy "" , we get distracted and end up not solving those problems we initially obliged to.
"
2963,5/15/22,3:02 PM , +234 818 047 2075," This talent issue will force our companies to think more creatively and probably work more closely with universities and that's something we have always wanted
"
2964,5/15/22,3:03 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," It requires investment which may not yield immediate profit 😂. 

 How many companies are ready to do that to build such pipelines? That’s where the challenge is really. 
 
 Many organizations want talents to come and hit the ground running and start churning out value and increase revenue. The global talent war will help organizations think creatively now really.

"
2968,5/15/22,3:04 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Imagine someone you catch young who finds his way to this group chat and hears some folks are collecting 4K to 8K on this group
"
2969,5/15/22,3:04 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi, But you can rely on the pool of talents and make decision on that most will stay 2
2970,5/15/22,3:05 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Microsoft is doing this using the cloud advocates
"
2971,5/15/22,3:06 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Well Octave Analytics to me has the best Talent Pool so far when it comes to Data science .

"
2975,5/15/22,3:07 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Which is also another option companies can use to retain their talents
"
2976,5/15/22,3:08 PM , +234 706 439 6712," With good strategy, workable system and deliberate commitment to make it work , it will work , Boss.    I strongly believe it.
"
2977,5/15/22,3:52 PM , +234 909 248 3462," Is it advisable to learn data science and data Engineering concurrently?
"

Also sometimes guys start with DS then transition into DE, you may choose to follow their footsteps if its convenient for you. Anyhow it appears to be, no choke yourself because concurrent learning is never a good idea in data space or in general.
 
 I chose Data Engineering path because I have always fantasied studying  engineering, all my life but couldn't , instead ,I was offered statistics finished among tops in my department, But still wants engineering. Like ""Engineering""  is the most romantic word  I have ever be came across, in my life.
 
 
 
 
 
 At least if I do Electrical or petroleum Engineering like I always wanted, I go be successful Data *Engineer* n even earn higher than those guys 😁

my only fear is people may not finish it up except you give them ample time like 2 weeks.
 
 One person on this group said he would send in his attempt today and that’s like getting it done in 24 hours

3169,5/16/22,4:36 PM , +234 903 783 8682," The instructor just copies and pastes code without explaining why he's doing it and what each line is supposed to do.

 They said the course assumes no prior knowledge of docker and it's supporting tools but it seems the instructor has forgotten.

 This same thing happened to me... I just abandoned the course and started data Engineering career track course on datacamp....
"
3174,5/16/22,4:51 PM , Condil," Datacamp that completes half of the code for you?
"
3175,5/16/22,4:53 PM , +234 703 786 9165," I disagree on this one. I'd only agree if you want a course that spoon feeds you and if that's what you want, check out DataCamp. 

 I started this today and yes I spent some time figuring things out but I got it figured out and my docker is working and I can see madass use of even the local version of docker already. 
 
 I think y'all need to be ready to do some research yourself and if you're not ready, stick with DataCamp.
"
3176,5/16/22,4:54 PM , +234 703 786 9165," The guy also didn't copy and paste codes so far from what I've seen. I think you need to be ready to use your googling skills Fam.

3179,5/16/22,4:55 PM , +234 703 786 9165," Did you change directory? Or you assumed that the command line will know which directory you're working in and run the docker file in that directory instead?

3378,5/17/22,11:35 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," For Savings sha I trust and understand Cowrywise model which is reliable and very understanding. They also have a trustee structure (they were the first to have that). So I no dey fear. 

 If there is anyone I will consider moving my money away I know that one which I will do that soon 
 
 Thanks for the nudge

"
3382,5/17/22,11:37 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I use Cowrywise for my savings and their investment ROI isn’t ridiculous and you can do your DD also.

"
3388,5/17/22,11:38 AM , +234 909 130 5248," My opinion is that most mainstream banks now do what these guys do and even better. I’m not saying Fintechs are bad, yes they solve some problems like seamless transactions which is what most people want, apart from that, they are very vulnerable to policies
"
3389,5/17/22,11:38 AM , +234 810 831 6393," Kuda chop my eye last year, I carry matter go report for CBN, maybe CBN go take serious action(s) on the matter tomorrow. The duos of @FCMB et @KUDAMFB are a no go area for me.

"
3398,5/17/22,11:40 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," And your money also devaluate. 

 Onyeka that put that up also understand you can’t just put your money in the bank that’s not a smart wealth management technique.
"
3399,5/17/22,11:41 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," So if you think you are playing safe for dumping your bank to just sit with GTB then that’s interesting 😂😂

 They start as Fintech, then buy a failing mfb to rebrand it
 
 But their activities aren't in line with what MFB were created for.

"
3408,5/17/22,11:44 AM , +234 810 831 6393," He calm down de lecture me about the difference btw the real MFBs (they're not safe to put much money into either), and the Yahoo ventures parading as Fintechs
"
3409,5/17/22,11:45 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You most likely can’t do without them in honesty 😂.  They democratize access to some asset class for you which is why you should do your DD, and the fact that there are shaky options doesn’t mean all are bad.
"
3410,5/17/22,11:45 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Even SEC regulated asset managers have trustees.

 ARM has one with an entity that isn't them.
 
 So does Stanbic, Cordros and most others.
 
 The trustee manages the fund.
 
 This creates some transparency to their activities
"
3411,5/17/22,11:45 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Summary do your DD well and also know LIFE is a risk 😂.

 I advised the client to use foreign hosting, he didn’t answer 😂😂

"
3663,5/17/22,5:52 PM , +234 703 806 5681," But I like the ease of wix. Plus if I need to add other stuff to the site, it's straight forward.

 
 Even integrated mailchimp then and earned myself a pair of their socks from Denmark 😂
 
 I'd rather deal with a platform that handles the nitty gritty work while I focus on what I want the site to contain and do for me.

 Quite urgent
 
 Thank  you

Has anyone here used redash? 
 And would you recommend this over Tableau? 
 
 If you have used both, do you recommend any over the other and why?

"
3815,5/18/22,9:45 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Tableau & Redash comparison will be difficult they kind of serve same purpose though different. 

 
 Redash on the hand is an SQL based viz tool but might be difficult to maintain too as the data scale if you don’t have a separate transformation/modeling layer
"
3816,5/18/22,9:46 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," To recommend what’s your current stack your BI layer will be consuming from?
"
3817,5/18/22,9:52 AM , +234 808 589 7009," Thanks man. 
Yeah, make sense. Only heard of redash today as someone was recommending this over tableau that i recommended.
 
 Using DBT to do transformation and modelling on redshift.
"
3818,5/18/22,9:53 AM , +234 814 833 4339," Hows the two compared to Apache Superset?
"
3819,5/18/22,9:53 AM , +234 814 833 4339," Does anyone have any idea?
"
3820,5/18/22,9:53 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Oh, cool you are implementing MDS
"
3821,5/18/22,9:53 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," In that case since you are using dbt as your layer you can check out Metabase or Superset
"
3822,5/18/22,9:54 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I think will fit much better in that stack. So your downstream user can the data and report they just need.
"
3823,5/18/22,9:55 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," And if your downstream stakeholders will need aesthetic reports then maybe you want to integrate Tableau/Power BI, but I doubt you want to integrate multiple BI layer at this stage

"
3827,5/18/22,9:57 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Superset is also an family of SQL based viz tool, however it’s similar to Looker & Lightdash because it also help you treat your report and dashboard as a code.
"
3828,5/18/22,9:58 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," This feature of treating report and dashboard as a code with version control and all is what others don’t have yet.  So you can explore Superset/Metabase/Lightdash and finalize which one works.
"
3829,5/18/22,9:59 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," They are all open source viz tool, so if your goal is to help your organization minimize cost and yet get the best you can go the open source route.

 Not been a fan of Metabase although I understand where Metabase shines especially if you are using a MDS and trying to improve data access and democratization in your organization. 
 I will probably just do some more research here. Thanks for your input, really valuable🙌

 Is *claims ratio* calculated flatly across the entirely earnings and disbursements of the fiscal year, or it varies according to the type of insurance policy different class of holders are subscribed to?

"
3844,5/18/22,12:55 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Hmmnnn... It depends on the company tho.

 Claims ratio can be calculated per customer portfolio, or per insurance class/product.
 
 But the major thing is the more the claims the higher the ratio.
 
 Ideally, it should be per customer portfolio, i.e. taking all the insurance products that the customer uses into account.
 
 @2348180472075, @2348141921557, @2348039160301 can add to this.

Per class, you’ll do this to know the rate at which the losses occur under each classes of insurance you do and enable you determine the high risks. Holistically will enable you know how the rate of claims you have per year in comparison to previous years.

"

You can have a customer with a high motor policy claims ratio cause of bad roads and security of where he lives but may have a lower ratio for other insurance policies.

 Age
 Health status (is the driver an alcoholic)
 Location (bad road) 
 Vehicle etc.
 
 So you can do claim ratio under these three factors but I think age is the grand factor.

"
3902,5/18/22,1:53 PM , +234 810 831 6393," So I can tell you from my experience (and what my model has pointed out to me) that age really might not be a good parameter. From our pilot phase, when we subjected the collected data to modeling, we that the most risky driver was an old man, the 2nd most risky was a young fellow, 3rd was also an old man.

 About the same thing played out in the category of safe drivers.
"
3903,5/18/22,1:55 PM , +234 810 831 6393," Now coming to practical explanations, for those who have lived in kwara before and knows Unilorin very well, my old man (dad) has on several occasions driven all the way from Ganmo to Unilorin under 15 minutes, which is one of the most dangerous things I think anyone would want to do
"
3904,5/18/22,1:55 PM , +234 810 831 6393," I have cousins who are wierd drivers as well

3905,5/18/22,1:56 PM , +234 810 831 6393," I used to be an ajala traveler before I stopped that earlier this year when the roads were becoming more unsafe
"
3906,5/18/22,1:57 PM , +234 810 321 0794," This is why it is a ratio. You’re definitely looking at a large number of people and there’ll definitely be exceptions. Out of 100 old people, less than 30 will be crazy drivers and over 50 young drivers will pose as a high risk on a scale of 1"
3907,5/18/22,1:57 PM , +234 810 831 6393," So trying to say younger people drive in risky manners, while the older ones drive in a safe manner might be untrue in all cases (using the Nigerian scenario)
"
3908,5/18/22,1:58 PM , +234 810 831 6393," Well you may be right, the pilot phase consists of 89 drivers, but the final model was built on 74 drivers who met the set standards for our modeling
"
3909,5/18/22,1:59 PM , +234 810 321 0794," Oh interesting
"
3910,5/18/22,1:59 PM , +234 810 831 6393," Probably when we have a larger number, we can get more clarity
"
3911,5/18/22,2:00 PM , +234 810 321 0794," For clarity, it’s not just old and young. It’s a range like 
"
3912,5/18/22,2:01 PM , +234 810 831 6393," So a major concern now is that with our systems, we are able to rank a driver as either being a safe driver, or a risky driver.

 
 How do you think this affects the decision of insurance companies in awarding claims to policy holders?
"
3913,5/18/22,2:02 PM , +234 810 831 6393, Then with our anti
3914,5/18/22,2:02 PM , +234 810 831 6393," How can these be factored into the claims ratio
"
3915,5/18/22,2:04 PM , +234 810 831 6393," Or better put, in this first scenario, what's the conventional way of dealing with such issues?
"
3916,5/18/22,2:04 PM , +234 810 321 0794," Okay, so those that are known as high risk can be charged excess of loss. 

 By excess of loss, you’ll pay part of your claims yourself by a particular percentage, say 30%
 
 So, if you have a claim of 100k, you’ll pay 30k and insurance will pay 70k. This will enable you take necessary precautions
"
3917,5/18/22,2:04 PM , +234 810 831 6393," I know (read) that insurance companies do carry out researches before they award claims to holders.

"
3919,5/18/22,2:06 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Ok
"
3920,5/18/22,2:06 PM , +234 810 831 6393," So regarding this, let's say a particular driver has come with claims more than once, does this also affect the amount he will be awarded for subsequent claims?
"
3921,5/18/22,2:07 PM , +234 810 321 0794," Yes, his premiums will also increase

"
3923,5/18/22,2:11 PM , +234 810 831 6393," So do you think our system will help insurance companies improve their claim ratios, while also protecting the interests of policy holders?
"
3924,5/18/22,2:12 PM , +234 810 831 6393," We're routing for UBI such that if as a policy holder, I don't come for a claim this year, then by next year, I should get some discounts in my premium

They are optimised for recording a transaction in a database and making sure they satisfy the ACID principle. If you want to use the database for purely analytics, DM is well optimized for that.

 So we are trying to build a powerapps platform across our group and we need to share with another subsidiary within the group but under a different domain

We need the location field in the form to be limited to the locations available per subsidiary. Currently it is giving all possible locations.

 Branches will help route each location based on the subsidiaries chosen.

 Please help us out 🤲🤲
"
4297,5/19/22,6:20 PM , +234 706 057 7846," Thank you bro for this question 😸.

 My eyes have seen shege.
 I don't have all the answers but below are what I often do
 
 1. I have links to some content that can be helpful. I have them pinned already to my Google keyboard. So I just share the links.
 
 2. I find rhythm in the issues people brought to me and I create videos on my YouTube channel for them.
 30minutes but full of answers to common questions that 1 out of 3 people ask me.
 
 3. Some people have unique needs, so I try to schedule a 15 minute call with them. I always keep to 15mins. I also document the discussion and action points. If the people come back later and haven't gone past the stage, that's a No for me.
 
 4. On weekends or any day less busy, I go through my LinkedIn and Twitter DMs and try to respond to as many as possible. 
 This has been most efficient for me. I also don't want people to think that I look down on them because they haven't made it 😂. Even a response saying *""Hi, thank you for reaching out. I am very busy this period but I will try my best to provide answers to your questions. If you didn't get to hear from me after 2 weeks, please say hi again"".*
 
 I also have this pinned on my keyboard again.
 
 These are what I do majorly to address this overwhelming audience.

 Does being an independent contractor for a remote company (when you're meant to be a FT staff) have any repercussions? financially or otherwise..
 
 Thanks

"
4302,5/19/22,6:23 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Independent contractor has to do with remote roles most times where the company is not available locally 

 So you can’t get tax payments benefits , insurance etc
 
 You handle those things yourself
"
4303,5/19/22,6:23 PM , +234 812 091 9501," What I do most times is refer you to some resources and see whether they would come back
"
4304,5/19/22,6:23 PM , +234 812 091 9501," If you come back, then I know you are serious if not, I won't stress myself

 Can you be specific on how you want me to help you?
"
4315,5/19/22,6:25 PM , +234 812 091 9501," Most people won't come back

 What do you want to achieve with this?
 
 How much time can you commit to this?
 
 And many questions

"
4330,5/19/22,6:38 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Someone literally conducted full interview for me in the DM

 Asking me why I think MS accepted me and even gave me options to pick from 😂🤣
"
4331,5/19/22,6:40 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Independent contractor is fine oo and best, I have served as that in a Free lance function 

 I was able to bargain for alot of perks personally. The headache there is you doing your work and invoicing customer at the end of every month
"
4332,5/19/22,6:43 PM , +234 708 531 6273," If you are in Europe, the implication of IC is that you will have to register as a sole proprietor at the local tax office and won't have many employment benefits like Temi said.No insurance and other things that are made compulsory by the local labour law.  

 You will be seen as an entrepreneur and the company contracting you will be seen as your customer. 
 
 You will have to declare the taxes from your business(Your salary in this case) yourself and give the government their share. If you like, japa with it 😅
 
 Also, because the company is not paying insurance and other stuff, your salary will be higher.
 
 But in Nigeria, it is a no man's land. It doesn't matter like that which one you choose. In fact, just go the independent contractor thing if your are in Nigeria.

 Just as @2348180472075 mentioned Khimball approach majorly leveraged the ETL paradigm prior the Cloud DW where storage and computing resources was a limitation. 
 
 Many approach proposed by Khimball still form the fundamental for any Dimensional Modeling, however there is more allowance for stuff as against the strict rules defined by Khimball. Interestingly many still hold on to Khimball, Data Vault and Immnon for that approach.  
 
 So the fundamental of Khimball star schema, fact and dimensions still applies only that now we now have options of leveraging OBT (One big Table). The approach to Dimension modeling is now opinionated which is very challenging because you have to decide if you want to adopt Khimball or OBT or an Hybrid and also determine when using Khimball will be much better.

 Or the structure is different with Data Products.
"
4701,5/20/22,9:33 PM , +234 904 894 6475," It really depends. In most cases I've seen, data product managers are those who were previously data scientists. But then, I know even DAs and DEs too can become data product managers. The idea is to be able to build, scale and democratise a data product.

 Data Analyst, Data Scientist(where AI or ML or anything engineer) and DE
 
 *All other roles dey disguise one way or the other* 🤣😂
"
4711,5/20/22,9:44 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Honestly, the space is still new. So there's a lot of disparity in how organisations handle data products and the associated roles. But typically, a data product manager will be in charge of data team leads, especially if the role is generic. What I mean is that some data product managers are tasked with very generic responsibilities, like handling the entire suite of data products. So imagine if the person is to coordinate everything from metrics to dashboards to machine learning to experimentation. Then you can be sure he or she will be supervising several team leads.

 However, some data product manager roles can be very specific. E.g., some just require you to focus on ML platform and strategy. In that case, such a person may be directly leading a team.
 
 Finally, I think there's a difference between a data product owner and data product manager. A data product owner may just own or build out something very specific and be in charge of that. More like the ""individual contributor"" role that is more common with senior software engineer positions. On the other hand, the data product manager will seat at the intersection of business strategy and technical operations. He will also manage people a lot, not just the product.

 Even then, it will be weird. A data engineer will definitely need additional specific training to handle those functions. This is why it's just realistic to allow new data paradigms emerge and fill those gaps that DA, DE and DS cannot fill.

"
4949,5/22/22,10:32 AM , +234 706 936 1298," Meaning GROUP BY on all fields should give same result
"
4950,5/22/22,10:36 AM , +234 812 216 8133," It chooses only unique values. 

 Say you have a column having 
 1) a
 2) b
 3) a
 4) a
 
 With 4 rows, but when you use distinct, it returns just 2, a and b.
"
4951,5/22/22,10:40 AM , +234 813 324 1349," GROUP BY groups unique records and allows you to perform aggregate functions.
"
4952,5/22/22,10:40 AM , +234 708 145 1890," That's if you are grouping by all columns.

 It's best to use GROUP BY when you have aggregation in your SELECT statement.
"
4965,5/22/22,11:01 AM , +234 706 936 1298," I see they both give the same result but both have their pros and cons and level of efficiency.

 Decided to try out these below queries on a dataset and they gave same result
 
 *QUERY 1*
  SELECT
     DISTINCT *
     FROM health.user_logs
     
 *QUERY 2*
   SELECT
     *
     FROM health.user_logs
     GROUP BY ID, log_date, measure, measure_value, systolic, diastolic
 
 Both queries gives same result but you cannot aggregate on QUERY 1 e.g COUNT(DISTINCT *) except you use a CTE, For QUERY 2, you can aggregate but like someone said here, its inefficient or waste of resources to GROUP BY on all columns
"
4966,5/22/22,11:02 AM , +234 706 439 6712," a) 

 SELECT DISTINCT* 
 
 FROM YDP
 
 ORDER BY Name;
 
 *Output"
4967,5/22/22,11:02 AM , +234 706 439 6712," Exactly...now u get the gist .
"
4968,5/22/22,11:07 AM , +234 706 936 1298," Much more clarity.

 Especially that *DISTINCT ** considers all fields (columns) unlike other opinions that says it uses only the primary key column
"
4969,5/22/22,11:07 AM , +234 706 439 6712," If u just want to a quick view of ur records returning all unique entries, use Distinct * ( capturing the entire table ).  But use Distinct ( give it a direction here by inputting the field (s) of interest )

 
 But when performing some aggregates on the detasets, better use *Group by*  saves time and energy....
"
4970,5/22/22,11:12 AM , +234 706 439 6712," That's for single table though.  .

 But 
 When it comes to multiple tables, u would need do some joining  or type out sub queries..  Queries inside queries..
 
 
 Tinz get a bit complex here , one needs to be very  careful when handling multiple tables

"
4989,5/22/22,2:16 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," That’s not totally true. 

 There are instances you may need to deduplicate your data when you know duplication exist, and GROUP BY on the required fields is what you often will do to deduplicate

 Not like distinct is not something you can’t use but people have used in bad ways in the past there by abusing its use. 
 
 In most cases people use it to hide badly written queries or codes in order to achieve their result and this can be consuming in some data env.
 
 So there’s this tradition out there that if the data model is good and all , you can use other better options to get distinct data by using other alternatives.
 
 Also to note that, distinct is inefficient in some data environments as it causes extra sorting of entire data and imagine if you now have so many records .
"
5002,5/22/22,2:42 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You can’t use COUNT DISTINCT with a windows function in Redshift

"
5071,5/22/22,6:50 PM , Condil," Please I'm not really getting this aspect of contributing to open source as a data engineer, and it seems like there are some core fundamentals one need to focus on to get there, most especially cores of software engineering. I said this since ETL is mostly about tools, and open source tool are mostly tending towards an aspect of ETL.
"
5072,5/22/22,6:55 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I think one very important thing for the data lead or head of data or CDO is to gain credibility and trust really fast. The how will vary from organisation to organisation based on maturity. For me, it was starting with BI because BI wasn't yet at a mature stage and I chose a use case that was visible to execs but also not to complex to execute. However, if I was leading the data team in a bank or telco, that probably won't fly, a DS use case would have been more ideal or even a DE use case where we simplify infrastructure and speed up time to insights. 

 I think it is important to scan the landscape before setting up the team and determining the high value low hanging fruits.
"
5073,5/22/22,6:59 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I think one also needs to move as fast as possible with a lean team. You can run BI and DS projects in parallel. If there a data issues, you can even add a data management project too. Getting visibility and credibility early is super important.

5135,5/23/22,12:01 PM , +234 818 047 2075," @2348164847452 pls need your thoughts. I have been trying to get a data catalog but mehn they can be quite pricey. >USD 30k. Earlier this year, I found one that has a reasonable price ~16k for a start, name is Ovaledge. I have been discussing with the vendor for a bit and I have seen that it has many features which means it is a one stop shop for cataloguing, lineage, Data Quality monitoring, Business glossary etc. The only part I am not sure it has is observability and I think that that is super important.

"
5139,5/23/22,12:45 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah, So for *Data Observability* . I asked myself if it checks these 3 boxes

 1. Metrics (Data Quality) ✅
 2. Metadata (data about data, like schema changes, logs etc) ✅
 3. Lineage (dependencies between data assets)✅
 
 And yes it does checks those boxes but getting the best out of it would depends on the kind of subscription you go for.
 So it can pass for observability
 
 *Reddit*
 
 So far, no discussion has ever been made on it yet on reddit for both the Data Engr Space on reddit and the whole of reddit but I have posted it as a discussion for reviews from any DE or data person that has used it. You can follow the discussion here (https"

 To add to the interesting discussion, I like to look at the data value stream as a coin with three sides — Infrastructure/DE as one face, BI/DA as the other face, while Data Science (ML, research, experimentation, etc) as the edge. 
 
 
 
 Preparing a data strategy that translates business strategy into tactical technology execution and resultant business outcomes is one of the first things a CDO or Head of Data needs to do, except there's already a data strategy in place. In fact, sometimes, a data strategy changes business strategy and forces the business to adopt new initiatives that can give it the advantage in the market (e.g., what Netflix did by blending a defensive and offensive data strategy). This kind of data strategy optimises the business strategy until it reaches doninance.

5163,5/23/22,4:48 PM , +234 817 925 1327," There are thousands of rows there. Does this need to be factored in?
"
5164,5/23/22,4:49 PM , +234 803 884 6009," I was going to say you could generate the script to include the schema and the data and just run it against the other db

"
5176,5/23/22,4:54 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Like just write a query to select from that DB table and save it directly as a table on the other db
"
5177,5/23/22,4:55 PM , +234 803 884 6009," This is another option. A select…. Into query
"
5178,5/23/22,4:58 PM , +234 816 484 7452," 4 ways to do it
@2348175115556 & @2348179251327
 
 1. Use the SELECT INTO QUERY
 2. EXPORT/IMPORT WIZARD
 3. Using Generate script if the table is not so large
 4. If it is a different server, you can use a linked server option
"
5179,5/23/22,4:59 PM , +234 803 884 6009," No 1.
Select * into destinationdb.tablename
 From  source db.tablename
"
5180,5/23/22,4:59 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Just google search the above things and you will be fine
"
5181,5/23/22,4:59 PM , +234 806 593 5396," Omo... Linked Server is med 😃
"
5182,5/23/22,4:59 PM , +234 803 884 6009," I have not used the last option before
"
5183,5/23/22,5:00 PM , +234 816 484 7452," And if the above seems stressful

 Use
 1. Airbyte
 2. SSIS
 3. ADF

 Spot on. 
 
 The best of Data initiatives can be pinned on the right Data strategy truly. The right strategy will influence the kind of data to be collected as well as the required infrastructure that will power the projected use case. 
 
 No doubt the skill sets required as a core technical person is somewhat different from Leading Data team.

5232,5/24/22,11:22 AM , +234 814 669 0593," Good morning. 
I think you should choose no unless you have permission to work in the state already. It is not likely to affect your remote work, but employers who need onsite workers and can't afford visa sponsorship will not be able to hire you. Some of them will ask if you will require visa sponsorship as well. 
 
 If you say you have the authorisation to work, you will be asked to present evidence to prove it.

Other times numbers the crispiest option available. Therefore, a good data professional should be able to switch modes when necessary
 
 One tool that helps geographers switch between space and numbers is spatial weights and spatial autocorrelation.
 
 Spatial weights help you describe geographical relationships with numbers. 
 
 In this notebook, I explored various spatial weighing techniques using the PySal library.

 During one of my research I discovered Forrester, another Data research company interviewed thought leaders of enterprise companies which form the basis of a report they released. 
 
 If we leverage of that understanding for Gartner too that means that report is subjective and the premise should be defined really 😂😂

If you are in an enterprise business, you will understand that the value that Microsoft Suite offers is difficult to be outcompeted by any other BI tools in the industry for some years. 
 
 For example, subscription for Zoom per user per month will get you the minimum Microsoft 365 Packages for a year which comes with over 15 Apps and Services. The same thing goes for ClickUp and many other Apps and services out there.
 
 These Apps and Services (Microsoft's) when combined together can solve $100k+ business problem in many scenarios. This is why the enterprise value will continue to be a great advantage.
 
 Coming down to BI Tools, the ability to use Power BI for Free within SharePoint List, within MS Teams for Teams Activity Analytics, and several other embedding capabilities within the ecosystem will earn then the top tier always.
 When a growing Startups get to a point where they started getting matured in Processes around Risk, Compliance, and Audit (on Data, Processes, and Regulatory domains), they will most likely adopt Microsoft Services to easily navigate that scenario but I stand to be corrected.
 
 Microsoft One Oasis playbook is the Ecosystem. They will continue to leverage on this to become leader in many technology areas in the coming years.

 1. Torture the dataset until it obey to you.
 
 2. Add a date table for time intelligence analysis...and remember to mark the date column of your date table as date.
 
 3. You can also extract the dimension table and fact table from the dataset, this will help your data modelling. 
 
 4. If it's a Senior role and you need the job badly, then feel free to impress them with unlimited DAX measures.
 
 5. Don't do one page Visualisation. Atleast 3 pages with different stories. 
 
 6. You can show up by adding the page navigation experience to your submission but don't overdo it.
 
 All the best....

As opposed to eager learners such as logistic regression, svms, neural nets, lazy learners just store the training data in memory. Then, during inference, it find the K nearest neighbours from the training data in order to classify the new instance.

"
5841,5/26/22,12:28 PM , +234 814 669 0593," Create an environment for it and try using pip and see if it works.

6019,5/26/22,6:20 PM , Abraham Musa," In UK for instance, I think organizations need to prove in a way that they couldn't hire anybody locally before proceeding to bring someone from the abroad.
"
6020,5/26/22,6:22 PM , +234 806 347 2085," But what about the remote jobs that you can do in your current location. They also reject for such roles
"
6021,5/26/22,6:23 PM , Abraham Musa," Yeah. And that's why @2348180472075 talked about competence. Sometimes I like to think that for every global role put on social media, there's about 50+ persons applying to same role.  Depends though
"
6022,5/26/22,6:24 PM , Abraham Musa," So, whether the role requires relocation or not, competence is another interesting topic entirely. The ability to package and sell your self very well is another.
"
6023,5/26/22,6:24 PM , +234 806 347 2085," True
"
6024,5/26/22,6:31 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Let's stay consistent and keep doing the hard work. International roles will definitely come. I believe it is  a matter of time. Things are really moving fast and it is probably closer than we think.

Reach out to your ward chairman and register as a member of the participant. Position yourself as a financial party member and sponsor a candidate of your choice by bankrolling their election bid at least from ward councilor level. Stamp your influence by making things happen within and outside the party. After doing the above, by the next election cycle, it's the party that will even offer you the delegate position.

"
6257,5/27/22,1:13 PM , +234 703 678 8365," You underestimate the population of your beloved country Nigeria. Not even a fraction of this population can japa due to how uneasy it is to actually japa (I mean the proper way).
"
6258,5/27/22,1:17 PM , +234 703 678 8365," Destiny?? 😅😅. You people should take it easy. Whether in Nigeria or anywhere else, a natural order of things will follow. 

 Nigeria is not the only place you can call home. Other places can become your home too. Like I said, not everyone can and will japa, no matter how trendy the topic may seem.
"
6259,5/27/22,1:17 PM , +234 706 439 6712," Not like every single one of us will Jappa.. I know that's not possible... But check the stats and rates at which ""Youths"", which accounts for more than 65% of our population, are "" Japparing""

"
6261,5/27/22,1:23 PM , +234 703 678 8365," During the times of my parents, Switzerland was donning out fully funded scholarships as well as some other countries that even led to permanent migration. During the time of my uncles, Ireland was massive on immigration and there was also a buzz word for it back then(can't remember). Often times, period of mass migration happens but I can say for a fact that people(youths in this case) can never be short of supply in Nigeria.

 After some critical reasoning, about everything, I came to a conclusion that ""No man owns nowhere, in the universe "" .   But natural habitation has made us believe that Nigeria or another place you might have found yourself, is the only place you can call home..to the extend will kill and die for our lands or the said natural habitation .

6268,5/27/22,1:52 PM , +234 909 130 5248," KMeans clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to group “data points” together into groups by calculating “centroids” or center points where other data points that are closer to the centroids are grouped with that centroid
"
6269,5/27/22,1:55 PM , +234 909 130 5248," This is an example 

 We have the whole of Ibadan as a big space (without the houses or anything, just a very very big land) filled with people on different points. Now we want to group the people using properties like “old”, “rich”, “healthy”, and the likes. To actually know these groups, we need to first calculate the positions of the most “old”, most “rich”, and most “healthy” among the people in the space. Calculating this allows us to zero in on the number of groups we want
 
 Afterwards, the distance between each data point and each of the centroids is calculated, and the smallest distance out of the calculated ones is attached to a centroid, and thus belongs to that “cluster”
 
 I believe this does it

6477,5/27/22,6:34 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," My strategy right from time has been, first get a job to pay bills make sapa won’t finish you. Then while at the job invest in self development and upskill yourself to start applying for jobs low key while at the job.

 One secret is if you can sign up using locations like USA, Canada, UK, e.t.c you'd bag more gigs than using Nigeria.. I don't know how they do this tho.
 
 Not kidding, a friend did that and she's bagged over $3k..
 
 Then with that, you can package it as ""rendering analytics services for over X international clients...""

 As an illustration, I would say AE decides what to cook, goes shopping for ingredients, prepare the ingredients and then Analysts use the ingredients to prepare a sumptuous meal. 
 
 But the Analyst is limited to the thought process behind the AE choice of meal and ingredients.

 I know R lovers will never agree. But I'm not the first to say this.
"
6777,5/28/22,5:48 PM , +234 812 091 9501," I have a lot of people who don't even know about programming that picked up R and found it interesting

 Come and see R Shiny, spiced up with JS, HTML and CSS.
"
6834,5/28/22,6:00 PM , +234 814 669 0593," Actually most of them know R more than python
"
6835,5/28/22,6:00 PM , +234 904 894 6475," I have not used R and I believe R is great at what it does. But I think for people who have a more programming/SWE background, it's easier to be more biased towards Python when you compare the two, and rightly so. R is more stats and computational science focused. And this extreme focus makes it so efficient.
"
6836,5/28/22,6:00 PM , +234 812 091 9501," Haa.. Let me check it out

 In all, before taking on a new programming language, there are things you should consider including whether it has a great community and support system
"
6844,5/28/22,6:03 PM , +234 812 091 9501," Yesh.. But some can't teach it

 I remember when I was still in Nigeria.. One of my daddys in Computer science asked me to come teach his year 3 students R..
"
6845,5/28/22,6:05 PM , +234 812 091 9501," Yeah.. I work with Coursera to create project based courses

 Currently at about 21k learners in all. 
 
 Funnily, it seems like I am the only one that teach R extensively.
 
 Another funny is that most people just started learning R
 
 I noticed that my SQL and Power BI courses has more learners

"
6847,5/28/22,6:06 PM , +234 812 091 9501," Thank God you agree to that

 A simple function can save you from writing 10 lines of codes
"
6848,5/28/22,6:06 PM , +234 904 894 6475," R has been more native to the academic science community. Python only in recent years started gaining traction with the vast majority of the science community after its lauded success in areas like CS & machine learning research.

6851,5/28/22,6:08 PM , +234 909 248 3462," Is it possible that while working on a project u use both R and python
"
6852,5/28/22,6:08 PM , +234 809 183 1446," Yea
"
6853,5/28/22,6:08 PM , +234 814 669 0593," But simple things get complicated too.

 Example,  managing dependencies  or installing library of a particular version or multiple libraries using different version of a dependent libraries and there is lack of backward compatibility
"
6854,5/28/22,6:09 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I will say R appeals more to the academic community while Python has more commercial relevance. if it is about statistical analysis and statistical packages, R definitely wins. But for industry grade solutions and commercial appeal, python wins. People in industry use R but very few when compared to Python. In the academic community, it is the reverse. 
"
6855,5/28/22,6:09 PM , +234 706 439 6712," Especially that FastAPI 🥰
"
6856,5/28/22,6:09 PM , +234 812 091 9501," R cannot die off definitely
I prefer Python personally because it is an all purpose language. It is versatile, robust and flexible.
 
 You know why?
 
 We will have data needs.. We will keep having computational needs
 
 And you will agree with me that R provides handy solutions to these needs more efficiently through dedicated packages that people have written to solve these needs

"
6864,5/28/22,6:13 PM , +234 814 669 0593," One of the main reasons for this is the ease of writing a research paper, statistical outputs,  and adding a bibliography to the paper directly using Rstudio.

 For analysis and technical functionality,  there is hardly what you can do with R that you can't do or create a tool to do it in python.

6875,5/28/22,6:15 PM , +234 703 678 8365," My first experience doing geospatial analysis with R was a disaster thoe. Very slow regardless of system specs and inefficient as compared to the regular geospatial softwares in the industry. 

 I was eager to see a programming alternative but was deflated and dissapointed to say the least.
"
6876,5/28/22,6:15 PM , +234 903 783 8682," Sure na.

 Perhaps it's because I don't look at it from the approach of trying to figure it out. Sometimes I just want to look at a piece of code and understand what is going on by its syntax. I hated JavaScript for failing at this, until I eventually got used to its syntax. Who knows, I might take interest in R some day too 😅

It's ease of learning comes at the expense of some classical programming customs. Many of us are victims of this. I started with C++, around 2013, although I struggled with it. But it made it a little easier to approach other languages after learning and getting used to Python. Take away that little C++ background and I would have a lot of trouble reading code in other prominent high"

6938,5/28/22,6:54 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Same thing with cloud platforms. Do you know many people who do data science/eng on cloud are mostly biased towards any of AWS, Azure or GCP?

 I started to use Oracle Cloud in 2020 and I was deeply amazed by its vast functionalities and flexibility for data science and DataOps. Most importantly, the data UX is something else. The truth is, just because something isn't popular doesn't mean it can't deliver or even outperform the popular ones. This is why in this data space, you have to constantly update yourself and get familiar with a vast array of tools. Otherwise you get outdated. It is true that we don't need to jump at every new tool, and even if we wanted, where's the time? However, just getting familiar with the various innovations in data science tooling and infrastructure would suffice.

 Early this year, I applied for a software developer role. The prerequisite was to build a graphql API and consume it with a react front end.
 
 It was the first time I heard of graphql. Yet I was able to complete the challenge within five days.

Does it mean one will need to create a list of the names and then use the df.column function or Is there any other shortcut?

 Just had to point out what vectors actually are in Python, in response to your question. Many times, we get so used to the array terminology, that we forget they can be different things (vectors, matrices or tensors).
 
 I'm not really interested in the Python/R argument. As I established earlier, I use whatever gets the job done most efficiently, based on the use case 😉

Simple is always better, and scenario analysis definitely works for these cases.
 
 The 2 approaches of ML and causal inference are just like going the extra mile and seeing how to further enhance decision quality. But certainly, the most reasonable thing a data scientist would do is to start with analytics.

Do you mind sharing how ML or causal inference will solved this. I like this because it is not the traditional ML usecase we see around.
 
 But if the same questions are posed to data or business analysts, the expected approach will be different.

The reason is that number 2 seems to depend on factors about the employees work experience and track records. Therefore we can adopt an improve baye's theorem referred to as Causal Calculus, e.g The probability that employee should gain subsidy because they spent this x"
7387,5/29/22,10:27 PM , +234 904 894 6475," The answer to this is that they are both causal inference problems. They are both problems that answer yes or no, either of which require evidentiary support because they are decision choices. Machine learning would not suffice to approach those questions, at least not in the way they were posed. The questions were posed as decision questions. The answer must be a single, justified, decision response. 

 
 For the rephrased question, machine learning will produce knowledge that asserts the likelihood of your decision quality being high, should you make the decision based on some metric. The likelihood is never a 100%. For the original questions, however, causal inference will produce knowledge that asserts definitively that your decision quality is high, whether it's a yes or no. Machine learning supports decisions, causal inference outputs decisions. To justify a causal inference assertion, the policy must prove to make better decisions than a person making decisions using the best available metrics from machine learning. That's more sophisticated than anything simple correlation can handle because the number of factors that contribute to decision quality is very high.
"
7388,5/29/22,10:33 PM , +234 813 324 1349, https
7389,5/29/22,10:49 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Interesting. No 2 is rightly causal inference. But if you implement Bayesian inference in the way you described it in your example, it would not be causal inference and the results would be off. Working out the probability that an employee should get the subsidy makes it a predictive probabilistic model. It means you are looking at each employee and computing the posterior probability distribution of the outcome, conditioned on the joint distribution of the observations for that employee. That is a predictive approach.

 Then, for question 1, check what I noted in my answer about the difference between the question versus when it is slightly rephrased. Question 1 is causal inference because it's a question of whether or not to make the decision. The response is a yes or a no that must be justified as the right decision. Machine learning doesn't justify decisions, it gives a certain likelihood that a decision quality will be high if the decision is taken based on some metric. Subtle differences 😁

7391,5/29/22,11:14 PM , +234 813 774 1580," Thanks for your input, but I disagree with you because conditional probability is different from causal calculus. The theory is the same but the mathematical application is different because causal calculus is based on actual occurrence of the event, e.g P(x | do{y}) "

"
7393,5/30/22,12:53 AM , +234 904 894 6475," @2348137741580, Again, interesting thoughts. Note that my goal in discussions like this is not to stimulate argument but to foster conversations that lead to better understanding of the nuances of subject matter.

 I like your emphasis on causal calculus; it's a powerful tool that extends Bayes theory to model the effect of interventions. However, you cannot say conditional probability is different from causal calculus. This is because causal calculus is built on it. The application is also not different; in fact causal calculus applies conditional probabilities.
 
 Secondly, the way you have described P(x | do{y}) makes it, in fact, the same as P(x | y) because the latter updates the degree of belief in x as information about the occurrence of y arises. For example, during inference in probabilistic modelling, we feed in data of actual occurrences to a trained Bayesian belief network or other suitable probabilistic graphical model, and the network returns the probability of the outcome based on those inputs that have actually already occurred.
 
 What you missed is that the difference between P(x | do{y}) and P(x | y) lies in applying external intervention to hold y constant in P(x | do{y}). In P(x | y), the y event can change and each time changes occur, our degree of belief in x gets updated. In P(x | do{y}), we set an intervention to force y not to change and want to see the combined effects of this intervention and the observations on x.
 
 
 On a last note, I agree with you that projects need not be rushed. A data scientist must carefully decompose the problem so well to understand what simple steps to take first before adding complexity if needed. However, I specified the 2 questions the way I did to present a data science use case that even many data scientists are not familiar with. My goal was specifically to stimulate reasoning about how to approach those problems from a decision science perspective. It doesn't mean they cannot be tackled in other, simpler ways. Also, machine learning can solve the 2 problems when you slightly rephrase them to shift from the decision maker to the data treatments the decision is to be made upon. 
 
 For us that come from the mathematics field, it's a lot easy to catch these nuances because of years of reasoning grounded in rigour. Communicating it to a broad audience is a skill only a fraction of us have.

 And the new company uses Stanbic. How do you go about it.
 
 And please is it that company just decide what to remove from your salary as pension or there's a general percentage?
"
7509,5/31/22,6:52 AM , +234 907 429 6313," You can always switch ...just register with the PFA ur new company uses and give them ur pension pin.
"
7510,5/31/22,6:56 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Employers aren't supposed to choose your pension administrator for you.
We operate a contributory pension scheme in Nigeria, u contribute from a minute percentage from ur salary, and ur employer thus too
 
 They're supposed to take who you have and deposit for you.
"
7511,5/31/22,6:59 AM , +234 907 429 6313," Theoretically! Yes
But in reality most company have an SLA with some PFA to make pension operation easy, and they might insist you switch.
 FYI! My firm as a PFA, they have suggested I switch but I haven't
"
7512,5/31/22,7:01 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Wasn't saying what was applicable.

 I'm saying it's wrong for them to do that.
 
 It's not acting in the best interest of the staff and everyone should be able to choose an administrator that provides the best return on their pension funds.
"
7513,5/31/22,7:02 AM , +234 812 527 3251," You honestly do not have to switch if you don't want to. The law says you provide a pension pin and that's all you are required to provide.

 If for some reason your company doesn't process your pension then they could get in trouble. It's one small mail to PENCOM.
 
 The SLA doesn't include you..

 Submit Workshop as very few people will submit a Workshop. 
 
 Workshop get easily accepted in every tech conference especially if it a topic trending with impact. 
 
 Like Analytics Engineering, MLOps and related 
 
 I'm not speaking because I'm among the organisers. 
 
 Just a hint have observed to get your session accepted

 N100m is my take.
 
 
 I would explain why .

"
8849,6/5/22,2:13 PM , +234 703 316 7142," So you need 1000 1M to get N1B.

"
8852,6/5/22,2:14 PM , +234 904 894 6475," In other words, that chance needs to be offered to you 1000 times to get ₦1bn.

 Whereas you could have actually got ₦1bn probably on the first or second try.

"
8855,6/5/22,2:17 PM , +234 703 316 7142," It will take 1000 people that collects N1M to get a single N1B. I'm willing to take the risk of those 1 thousand people than be among the masses🌚
"
8856,6/5/22,2:17 PM , +234 818 213 4637," The throw is happening just once. 

 So it implies that I have 50% chance at 1 billion. Quite risky I suppose. 
 
 But I can sell the risk. There are insurance companies that can buy a share in the bet. 
 
 If I can sell the entire bet price in shares, I’m guaranteed at least 500M provided I get good deals.
"
8857,6/5/22,2:17 PM , +234 703 160 7868," Hmmm...so that's 1000 months to earn N1B. Even in 100 years I won't earn a billion if I'm collecting N1m per month.

 But taking a second read, and saw that the poser really mentioned a dice with 2 options. So what happened to other faces of the dice 🎲 or what type of dice is this?🥲🙆🏾‍♂️

 If you get 1bn you have more free cash flow to play with. 
 
 If you get nothing, you're not worse off than you were before.
"
8871,6/5/22,2:23 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Frankly, I can take any of the two choices and justify that it is the right choice. 

 A simple probability approach will justify option 1 is the right decision.
 
 A utility theory approach will justify that option 2 is the right one.

In this case, 2 birds in the bush are worth more than a bird at hand
 
 Dividend vs Growth stocks
 
 You can get guaranteed passive income from your stocks in dividend companies. Low risk
 
 Or invest with a potential growth company and get more capital appreciation that out performs the market. High risk (chances are your bet may be wrong)

8911,6/5/22,2:37 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Exactly. But I'm still waiting for a response going with option 1, with good justification
"
8912,6/5/22,2:38 PM , +234 703 806 5681," I think if we added certain   other justifications, we may have more 1s than 2s.
It's related to YDP
 
 A certainty of money will become more important than the risk of losing it entirely.

8913,6/5/22,2:39 PM , +234 708 145 1890," There are quite a number of variables to consider.

8915,6/5/22,2:39 PM , +234 904 894 6475," More people will definitely go for option 1 if it were dollars.

 The idea of $1bn is cognitive overload for most people. Easy to think of the prospect of winning $1m.
"
8916,6/5/22,2:39 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Totally yes.

 If your family knows, they will pressure you self 😂

That's why I specified ""company"". A company wouldn't have all the typical personal problems.
 
 The burden of more mouth to feed will even make you think twice.

8926,6/5/22,2:42 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," True 😂😂
"
8927,6/5/22,2:42 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Well, companies have risk appetite too sha.

 Let's consider that, as well as their corporate strategy.
 
"
8928,6/5/22,2:43 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Kai... statistical thinking! 😁

"
8931,6/5/22,2:44 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Exactly. If it were to be in $$$, you will find lots of companies leaning towards option 1. Low risk appetite, and option 1 has no risk.
"
8932,6/5/22,2:44 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Now if you were given the option to toss one more time, I'd definitely say pick option 2
"
8933,6/5/22,2:44 PM , +234 817 840 3767," 🤦🏽‍♂️
"
8934,6/5/22,2:45 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Since the question is directed to a Data Scientist which mean not relative to personal finance where Individual risk appetite varies based on varying factors. 

 In the context of an organization, I think the odd of going with option 2 will be higher
"
8935,6/5/22,2:45 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Now, that $1m is already in the bag 😁
"
8936,6/5/22,2:46 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Why do you think so?
"
8937,6/5/22,2:46 PM , +234 703 160 7868," Then we would have had a serious problem subjecting this to both rational/irrational thinking.
"
8938,6/5/22,2:46 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Having worked both ends, I can say that business finance isn't so different from personal finance.

 Take one and you can comfortably substitute the other.
 
 Just my observations over time.
"
8939,6/5/22,2:47 PM , +234 904 894 6475," I guess I shouldn't have just streamlined it to data analysts/scientists, seeing that we have already gotten solid insights from other disciplines 😂
"
8940,6/5/22,2:47 PM , +234 703 806 5681," We can never separate behavioural bias from the issue of money.

 Never 😁
"
8941,6/5/22,2:47 PM , +234 904 894 6475," If you are approaching it as a data scientist, you will have to suspend irrational thinking.
"
8942,6/5/22,2:48 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Because, in this case, you are not taking the decision for yourself
"
8943,6/5/22,2:48 PM , +234 703 806 5681," So you'll assume rationality?

 Even when people are inherently irrational?
 
 I'd like to see how behavioural science affects data analysis 🤔
"
8944,6/5/22,2:49 PM , +234 703 160 7868," Absolutely 💯
"
8945,6/5/22,2:49 PM , +234 904 894 6475," No I don't dispute the interplay between behavioural science and data science, especially in complex scenarios of decision making under uncertainty
"
8946,6/5/22,2:49 PM , +234 703 160 7868," Exactly.😌
"
8947,6/5/22,2:52 PM , +234 904 894 6475," In fact, decisions are leading indicators of behaviours
"
8948,6/5/22,2:53 PM , +234 703 316 7142," So let's put it this way, you are given this options"
8949,6/5/22,2:55 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Relative discrepancy of value.  

 1M —> 1B alone  and knowing there is an odd with a probability of getting the higher return. 
 
 DS itself build base on probability.
"
8950,6/5/22,2:56 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," There is Behavioral Data Science as a field of DS
"
8951,6/5/22,2:57 PM , +234 904 894 6475," For me, the goal is not to suspend irrationality entirely. But when I put on my DS tool belt I have to be precise enough to understand the limitations of my rationality and, if it's worth it, be disciplined enough to go with it despite my irrational objections.
"
8952,6/5/22,2:57 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Nice.
"
8953,6/5/22,2:57 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Okay. Fair enough.
"
8954,6/5/22,2:58 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Is this the same as Decision Sciences?

 I just want to be clear
"
8955,6/5/22,2:58 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Nah, it’s not.
"
8956,6/5/22,2:58 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Yes. This is where decision science interplays with data science.
"
8957,6/5/22,2:59 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Already sounds interesting
"
8958,6/5/22,2:59 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Let me look for an article I read one time about the emergency of the role.
"
8959,6/5/22,2:59 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Not exactly the same, but there's an interplay

8970,6/5/22,3:04 PM , +234 809 183 1446," As someone who has a net worth < 1M 🌚

 I'd for for the 1M..
 
 There's a 50% of getting 1M compared to ~17% of getting 1B.
 
 Let's go local a bit.. when playing Ludo or monopoly, how often does one roll a double number? 😅

"
8975,6/5/22,3:08 PM , +234 904 894 6475," The problems I posted the other day about causal inference are also behavioural problems. Where a company has to decide whether or not to subsidise college education for its employees.

 Here knowledge from data science, behavioural science and decision science are needed to fully specify the complex relationship between the decision and the outcome.
 
 Because as it turns out, there's a complex behavioural dynamics that influences performance on the job. A company has to know whether having educated employees will optimise this behavioural dynamics and ultimately improve job performance. If job performance improves, the decision is high quality. Else, the decision is low quality. With causal inference, we can test several combinations of behavioural dynamics until we fully understand what exact combination is required to maximise the desired outcome. With that full policy, we can then infer whether or not the decision is high quality.

 Reinforcement learning is one of three broad categories of Machine Learning.

 With 2 options, there are different ways the die can be formed...
 One is what @2348131517157 pointed out as 3 faces for 1B and 3 for zero... But then, 1 face for 1B and 5 faces for zero is totally possible as well...
 
 No one said anything about the die being unbiased...

9038,6/5/22,4:35 PM , +234 904 894 6475," The goal of an analytical approach like this is not to definitively make money in every single scenario, but to quantify what decision is best to take and how much risk that decision exposes you to. 

 For example, you opt for the second option not because you know for sure you will get ₦1bn in one trial, but because you know the probability of getting it and you know the expected utility. 
 
 The goal is not to make money every time, but to take the risks that will bring about the highest cumulative gains when such offers come over and over again.
 
 It will take this trial being repeated 1000 times to get to ₦1bn if we always choose option 1. But for option 2, even if we get ₦1bn twice in 1000 trials (which is almost impossible), you already have twice as much.

 Access Bank and Zenith Bank have the gross earnings from the column heights but from the data labels it's quite opposite as Access Bank has a higher Gross earning than Zenith.

This is more of an infographic design and the brilliant use of color helps readability for me. At a more closer look, it obvious that the sort was based on PAT in ascending order and Zenith Bank had more PAT than other banks despite the fact that it is the second highest in terms of Gross earning. GTCO had the least Gross Earning but more PAT than FBN Holdings and UBA.

I think this could help because data latency  and late data arriving could be a potential cause. 

 And for intermediate layer where there is correctness in source data, a custom logic can be built into the transformation more like a unit testing the models. dbt makes this achievable in combo with Great expectations

9241,6/6/22,8:44 PM , +234 816 484 7452," We need to understand that it is difficult to present something technical casually to business guys wey no sabi jack. So I would suggest this line of approach below.

 Firstly ehn, this is not happening for the first time and since according to them, these 2 or 3 rows affects figures greatly. I would want to say it is some kind of accounting scenario as trust me if the top Stakeholders gets displeased easily with this (which seems more like a toxic workplace to me already)  then, they should have done the following.
 
 0. Understand why the business is so irritated and angered by this. 
 
 1. On the second occurrence, they should have escalated seriously in such a way that they would let the Business Top Guns know the consequences of having to handle this from the internal team's end and raised SLA concerns because this is third party data. SLA and compliance are very important when dealing with third party data. It is good as Engrs to know what level of accuracy to expect when dealing with external systems so as to put this into design consideration. Read the docs and understand the SLAs of this external tools and systems first.
 
 
 3. And Since the third Party Guys kept giving the same response, they should have revisited their current Data Env Design and let let the business know the extra cost to put checks on validating extra data because this would mean special implementations on logs and monitoring of Source data.(Though this would give room for even some redundant implementations just to make sure data is valid)
 
 3. Propose new solution and cost analysis to the business on what accommodating this discrepancy from the internal team end would look like.
 
 4. Get the Business Final decision and shoot
"
9242,6/6/22,8:45 PM , +234 816 484 7452," But Business Stakeholder wanting to fire entire team is a Red Flag for me.

 It probably means they haven't been getting adequate value from their data.
"
9243,6/6/22,8:47 PM , +234 816 484 7452," *If they don't clear the business rift between Engrs and the business, then they won't even be able to clear the major technical bug in their data*
"
9244,6/6/22,8:48 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I bet to disagree with your 2nd paragraph o about the disposition of stakeholders been toxic 😂

 I believe working with sensitive financial and regulatory data, an accuracy of  100% will be what they are looking for. So I don’t think that’s toxic sha😂
"
9245,6/6/22,8:48 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Because Engrs handling a Million Dollar Project are definitely capable of building technical solutions to solve such bug
"
9246,6/6/22,8:49 PM , +234 816 484 7452," The reason I said so is because, it is as if there is *NO FORM OF EMPATHY* on the Engrs

 Is it easy to build scalable systems like that. 
 Engr is iteration upon iteration to get the best system
"
9247,6/6/22,8:52 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Yeah even with 100% accuracy expectations, Third Party or External guys are already involved. Na why I talk sey SLA dey important here.

 The Engrs would just need to communicate this to their Business guys properly by story telling it as I said. Though it is still a toxic environment sha.
 
 *Stakeholders are MAD* it is the word *MAD* for me.

"
9255,6/6/22,9:00 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Normally when designing systems, there would have been provision for this. The best thing to do is to attack it vigorously when it occurs once so that it never happens again.

 At the beginning, you literally can't over design as part of the goal of a DE is Cost Optimization in terms of Infrastructure.
 So it is an iteration you would keep improving on.
 
 *Just make sure to attack it with all you have got when it happens once*
 
 Even the big techs suffer data bugs like this once in a while.

So Casted a life😂🤣
 
 Finding love is a journey and lots of comprises do take place when you finally found the perfect match.
 
 At this point, the weight attributed to the spouse profession might be highly negligible.
 
 
 Recently, I have seen Tech Bros and Sis hooking up to each other. This seems natural to me as the Tech circle grows bigger, the likelihood of finding a mate increases 😊. For example, some bros are eyeing some of our YDP ladies 😂. You see... Simply because there is a growing community. Things were not really like this 5 years ago.

 It becomes a problem when the engineers are not aware of this clause or don't even have access to the SLA. It's easier to build precautions aforehand when you already know the impact of the slightest failures.

According to him, chaos means things are constantly evolving. When things are evolving, the space keeps growing. As the space grows, opportunities keep opening up.
"
9394,6/7/22,8:11 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Yes. 

 I was shocked to hear that too during his presentation 😂😂
 
 Working with the MDS truly will be chaotic as more tools unfold creating an overhead and bottlenecks as it relate to managing. 
 
 The number of vendors I have tested their products that integrate with MDS in the last 6 months really proves there will be lot of chaos and difficulty to decide the tool stack to setup and how to properly manage which will increase billing. 
 
 It’s really interesting to behold the space evolve and catch up with it

 Omo I get a data model challenge I have been racking my head about..
 
 The goal is to create a MRR model and churn model. 
 
 1. It's a subscription business
 
 2. A subscription by a customer lasts for 4 months. For example, if I subscribe with 10k in January 2023, it will expire in April 2023. And if I don't subscribe again in May 2023, then I would have been considered churned.
 
 3. Number 2 above implies that a customer can have only max 3 subscriptions per year.

"

"
9739,6/8/22,10:09 AM , +234 703 845 5619," every subscriber must complete the cycle as one payment covers for the 4 month cycle. 

 Active months would be the months included in the cycle
"
9740,6/8/22,10:10 AM , +234 703 845 5619," yes sir. 

 churning only starts if the customer does not renew after the 4 month cycle.

"
9742,6/8/22,10:11 AM , +234 703 845 5619," I want to also prorate the payment made in the first month through out the remaining months in the cycle.

"
9757,6/8/22,10:24 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," One more question I don’t want to assume. 

 How does your source system capture subscription date? Does it only reflect the start/end date for for each subscription/users? Like what’s the granularity of the subscription data from source?
"
9758,6/8/22,10:24 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," *subscription data 

 ~subscription date~
"
9759,6/8/22,10:26 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi, Maybe as follow
9760,6/8/22,10:26 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," ?
"
9761,6/8/22,10:28 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi, *May
9762,6/8/22,10:36 AM , +234 703 845 5619," Okay this is the interesting part😄

 
 If 1 subscribe this month, the source system only captures the date of payment i.e January and ignores the other months in the cycle. 
 
 and if another payment is made after the cycle, the system only captures the date of payment. 
 
 In other words, the source system does not capture the cycle. 
 
 Another case in the source system is how it handles Annual payments. 
 
 If I pay in January for a whole year, this equals 3 cycles of Jan to April, May to August, Sept to Dec and the source system only captures the dates JAN, MAY and SEPT with the same subscription_id for the period; i.e 3 records with the same subscription_id and dates that only match the start of the subscription. 
 
 I however created surrogate key for subscription_id as I believe that each subscription whether annual or one time payments should be unique. 
 
 2. Based on your analogy, if you subscribe in January only one record is created for your with date in January. If your next sub is in Nov, the system only captures one record for that with date in Nov. 
 
 
 Please ask more for further clarification boss
"
9763,6/8/22,10:40 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Great, it’s the expected. 

 That means there is a subscription type field that indicate whether it’s annual the user subscribed to or quarterly right?
"
9764,6/8/22,10:40 AM , +234 703 845 5619," yes sir.
"
9765,6/8/22,10:57 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You may not necessarily need uniqueness per se since the subscription_id only identify unique subscription. 

 I’m thinking through an approach leveraging on your shared info
"
9766,6/8/22,10:58 AM , +234 703 845 5619," okay okay,
"
9767,6/8/22,11:02 AM , +234 703 845 5619," so an annual payment would be a unique id that applies on all 12 months of the year?
"
9768,6/8/22,11:06 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Spot on. Since the id is tied uniquely to just 1 customer. You will factor annual subscription into your modeling. 

 Annual/quarterly doesn’t really matter per se in this instance since your goal is to capture activeness and inactivity, so you already know if a customer has an annual subscription that mean the  customer will be active next 12 Month ahead. 
 
 However, your modeling approach may now change if you want your downstream user to have a filter that indicate subscription type in case they are interested in knowing with subscription type have the impact on MRR. This is also possible but will create little complication in modeling. Since they haven’t asked you just assume they don’t need it yet 😂😂 when they do you will update the existing model you built without considering that.

 Can you create a sample of how your current data looks like?

 Is this it?
"
9772,6/8/22,11:24 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Another question pop up 

 Is it possible for a customer have multiple active subscription at a time?

"
9782,6/8/22,11:35 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Nice. 

 Your first task is to remodel this date to look like this ;
 
 subscription_id | customer_id | start_date which is the payment _date | end date which will be dependent on the subscription type | amount 
 
 E.g 
 
 
 Use that logic to calculate end date for each customer and subscription

 A customer can have 2 annual or 1 annual/1 quarterly?

"
9791,6/8/22,11:42 AM , +234 703 845 5619," A customer can have 3 vehicles and have 3 different annual subscriptions on those vehicles and based on product as well.

"
9795,6/8/22,11:49 AM , +234 703 845 5619," please to clarify boss....

 this would return aggregated row for an annual payment right? 
 
 system captures 3 rows for annual payment with the same created date and the amount for each row. 
 
 This first model would return one row for an annual payment with start date as payment date and end date as 12 months later and amount the total amount?
 
 right?
"
9796,6/8/22,11:52 AM , +234 703 845 5619," and so a unique row for a unique subscription and can have multiple customers. right?
"
9797,6/8/22,12:01 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," The dynamic of having multiple subscription based on products don change the logic I get for my head 😂
"
9798,6/8/22,12:03 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Since there is possibility of multiple subscription. 

 Let this table include product_type. 
 
 So the granularity will be subscription/customer/product (use can use this later to create a surrogate key)
"

"
9806,6/8/22,12:23 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Next approach after transforming the source data to reflect the above. 

 Create a Date spine model to reflect one record per customer per product per month 
 
 
 To create this. 
 
 Create a utility date dimension for each months from your db start date to current date (use dbt_utils.datespine)

 As a rule of thumb even if you don’t have any test just check for uniqueness. If it has to make you create a surrogate key when primary key doesn’t exist, do that and test the surrogate key for uniqueness.

If you are sure you are doing the joins rightly, then to remove duplicates, you can select 2 or more of the similar columns then write a row_num over partition by clause in a sub query. Then outside the sub query filter row num to = 1 in a where xlause

 Analytical thinking to me is being able to break things down, reducing their complexity, solve the parts and build back the whole solution.
"
9907,6/9/22,9:40 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I don’t think there is a course per se that teaches these things actually. I can’t remember taking any for me sha. 

 
 What I will say helped me is basically reading a lot of articles, blogs and conversations of folks to understand how they think and approach a task and subtly I start seeing myself see things differently , so it rub off. I believe that’s the best way rather than going to go and look for one soft skills course. 
 
 Till date I try to read atleast 3 articles or read conversations on random stuffs on slack every day. It just help me see how others think and approach a task, so next time I see a similar task I already have an idea of how to tackle it.

 Just as @2347031607868 mentioned feel free to ask your question without feeling intimidated. Groups such as this exposes your mind to what is possible and you have access to folks. 
 
 
 I’m in a group on slack that I barely understand anything they say but I’m still there and in the midst of all their technical jargons one or 2 things sticks.
"
9912,6/9/22,9:46 AM , +234 703 806 5681," There are no hard and fast rules to these things.

 You'll realise that on some jobs, you thinker deeper than others.
 
 You may find that critical thinking comes more naturally to you than others.
 
 If you're a ""big picture"" person, it might be less natural than a ""details"" person.
 
 Learn from others.
 Learn by doing.
 Learn from feedback.
 Take a course if you need to (this also feeds into learning from others, who then give a structured path to how they approach problems)

 You may need to learn some stuff in the context of what you need it for. Communication skills maybe you don’t but critical and analytical thinking you sure need to learn in the context of what you want to do.
"
9922,6/9/22,9:50 AM , +234 818 047 2075," This helps alot. 

 A few books that I have read and think can help indirectly.
 * Naked statistics by Charles Wheelman
 * You are not so smart by David Mcraney 
 *Numerate life by John Paulos
 
 I haven't read the Numerator life book but I plan to. Heard it is a good one
"
9923,6/9/22,9:50 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," That’s why books targeted to soft skills in Data will be much better than a general soft skills book or course.
"
9924,6/9/22,9:52 AM , +234 703 806 5681," You use critical and analytical thinking for more stuff than Data.

 This point, I stand by.

9929,6/9/22,9:56 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Digging deeper into work specific isn’t inferior either if you are a more generalist really. 

 And yes, I will recommend learning critical thinking and analytical mindset to Data from standpoint of analytics rather than generic if that’s what the person want to learn as it relate ti analytics

9945,6/9/22,10:00 AM , +234 818 047 2075," You get a free book every month.

9946,6/9/22,10:00 AM , +234 818 047 2075," Then they do sales too

"
9948,6/9/22,10:00 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," And like you said no hard and fast rules. 
My monthly subscriptions don plenty
 
 I didn’t take any course or book on generic critical thinking. I shared my approach that helped me till date. Atleast I can’t remember reading any book on how to thin critically or analytically 
 
 Another person may choose another option that suit them. I guess that’s the interesting about learning that there is no fixed rule. And that’s why I didn’t respond as an authority but more as an opinion

 And the market assigns the value. One important factor is ""demand""
"
10216,6/13/22,1:23 PM , +234 818 047 2075," So depreciation says you lose some value each year due to usage
"
10217,6/13/22,1:23 PM , +234 818 047 2075," That value could be some where between 15 and 20% per year
"
10218,6/13/22,1:25 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I would expect that after 4 years that resale value drops to 20% or 30% or less
"
10219,6/13/22,1:25 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Depreciation is hypothetically assigned. There are no standard rates for it.

 And on an annual basis, you can revalue an asset and start depreciating again.
 
 So... even at disposal, you still need to check for resale value (scrap value). Which is technically what happens with cars.
"
10220,6/13/22,1:26 PM , +234 703 806 5681," No. You're not the market and the market isn't you.

"
10225,6/13/22,1:27 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Yes. Demand and Supply.

 Price affects this at a granular level.
 
 And other factors like custom duties etc, can affect the price.

 At the start, some of us were just competing for high grades, but we were never actually learning statistics. It was in my year 3,  I had a lecturer called. He observed I was among those  good in solving questions n getting marks.....  But when it came to interpreting the data or the analysis, we all became dumb, we couldn't make any sense of what were solving. That was when I knew I needed to do some personal work

 Remember Statistical Theory. We call that course copy and paste. You just have to find a way to memorise the theorems and pour them back to the lecturer.
 
 Most of the theorems didn't make sense because the lecturer couldn't explain as well.
 
 Numerical methods sitting in a league of its own. 🥵
 
 Online courses came to the rescue after school though. But I wish something can be done about how our teachers teach. Because the courses they taught us were relevant but mostly theoretical and lacked depth. They also discourage new ideas and methods that are not present in the books they copy from.
 
 I remember that they usually hide the text book they teach from. This reminds me of Operations research and Experimentation.

"
10350,6/14/22,8:30 AM , +234 816 424 7582," I think the Fundamental problem is that no one actually wants to teach University in the Uni anymore...

 Its Just a sacrifice to do so...no young good head would want to sacrifice remote Job for lecturing in LASU or what not....
 
 The Academic environment in Nigeria is generally repulsive for Talents...even if you have. Passion to teach, one would rather do it off Uni walls...

10475,6/14/22,10:50 AM , +234 816 296 3527," Computer Science. We had a lecturer that downloaded questions from the internet. That semester we were covering DBMS (relational databases). 

 The students from the Computer Science department failed his test because some of the questions were from topics they had not touched.
 
 Someone figured that the questions were from a website. The website has over 10k questions on relational databases.
 
 All Yiu had to do was download and print the questions, and then answer them as many times as possible.
 
 Practice makes perfect.
 
 That's how you get good grades. I got extra marks for doing better than the students in the Department of Computer Science.

 Discuss with all stakeholders to drop there adhoc requests before a certain time 2pm as an example and let them know when it will be ready. 
 
 Inform them any request that doesn’t come in before your set time will be deprioritized till the next day. 
 
 You can then allocate some few hours within the day to address the requests. And you can also have a day set aside for infrastructure work and let them know that day you aren’t attending to any request

"
10669,6/15/22,7:31 AM , +234 706 057 7846," Profisee and Microsoft Purview does more than Data Cataloguing.

 
 It's better to see the need for overall governance because the moment you are done with cataloguing, more governance topic will come up and if the tool isn't robust enough to address those needs, you end up spending twice, this time around costlier than before.
 
 Let's start from there.
 
 In terms of cost, Microsoft Purview is cheaper compared to tools like Collibra.
 
 I did some backward reversibility accessment on this tool in the past and overall, Microsoft Purview stood out for us.

 You will install integration runtime on your OnPrem and use this to connect.
 
 It will automatically scan all tables on your connected data sources and keep them for glossary, classification, and lineage tracking. Good for metadata management too

 🌻So, you will define Business Rules.
 🌻 create Data Quality Metrics from the business rules
 🌻Then create thresholds from the Quality Metrics.
 
 
 Finally, your SQL Engine 😁.
 1. Create table for business domain and data field
 2. Create another table to store data quality rules and metrics with thresholds.
 
 These tables are relational.
 
 This will make your data quality activities programmable as you have parameterised the fields involved. It becomes easier to also scale. You can expand across different domains. 
 Customer, Products, Agents, etc..
 
 The last part is implementation, you can use any programming language here, I only have experience with C# implementation and SQL.
 
 You can write SQL Stored Procedures functions to evaluate each data quality rules picking rules, values, and thresholds dynamically from the tables and store the results in another table which gets plugged to Power BI for visualisation.

 All respect to the father of DW himself Daddy “Khimball”. Remove a proper DM in a data warehouse work, it’s actually chaotic and a mess. 
 
 There are a lot of bottlenecks that make it a difficult. I think the major issue with the MDS is the “JOIN PROBLEM”. Integrating  data from multiple sources create a bottleneck that now require complex queries to build a model for a metric.

 The question I will like to ask is what is the significance of knowing the total nulls across all columns? I understand if you are investigating per column.
"
10953,6/16/22,4:58 PM , +234 814 833 4339," Let's assume you have 100 columns that are highly consequential to your analysis and you have to run through each column individually to check, its tedious

 Some domains all you need as apex is get a degree and that’s it and once a while modus operandi of how things are done can change. Not same in tech
"
11031,6/16/22,7:07 PM , +234 708 675 3621," There's this arrogance that comes with us folk in tech that makes us feel like we are pioneers which is not far from the truth but remember every field was at its peak at some point before it became monotonous, it truely takes someone who loves said field to turn the monotony into something of beauty, 

 And I get where you're coming from, you're looking at different fields through your tech lens but you forget that learn sometimes you gotta unlearn and step back for a while a field like accounting for example can not be appreciated by someone like you who only sees the tech side of things
"

 This isn’t from a standpoint of under appropriate any profesion really. No one is inferior to another and just like you mentioned passively, everyone won’t do tech and may not love it. 
 
 So the post and conversation didn’t stem to deter love for other professions but rather from how things evolve in the space.

 So it’s not saying folks in the accounting space don’t learn or anything. 
 
 Another person may not like tech because of that fast paced nature to constant keep up with things and learn new stuff and all which can be overwhelming and stressing really. So no one is discrediting any profession really
"
11040,6/16/22,7:16 PM , +234 806 446 0528," After this, some countries no dey use ifrs self. You gast learn their standard

 The conversation flow which I believe the post shared speak to is the fact that to *do well* in tech generally you need to have knack for *continuously learning* not necessary curiosity because  that can be learnt. 
 
 So, yeah you are 💯 correct with no contradiction that the skill is valid and needed across profession.

 Someone like me would be bored and tired of it. The moment I get to an apex of learning where I feel nothing challenging again or no new learning and I can literally deliver the job without any prep or anything , then frustration start setting in. 
 
 Another person make like it that way, no stress 😎. So yeah your angle is very valid about continuous learning been relative even in the space itself and doesn’t make that person inferior or less fulfilled

 There are people who are positively upset when someone posts a ""win"" online or talks about getting something like a visa, etc.
 
 I'm really trying to understand why anyone would think these things are unnecessary.

 And you're correct in saying we shouldn't project our preferences on other people.
 
 Even the Bible wants us to testify of God's goodness. Unless we believe what we have received didn't come from him.
 
 I've also learned that acknowledging a good thing and telling others about it give them hope. And hope keeps a lot of people sane and motivated to keep trying and waiting for their own miracles.

 _They feel it's luck or mere chance, forgetting that time and chance happens to everyone.

 But I also believe irrespective of what the ""enemy"" does with our dreams and visions, God has control over everything in the known and unknown universe. He will work ALL things for our good.

11520,6/17/22,11:25 AM , +234 904 894 6475," Ian Goodfellow, the guy who invented generative adversarial networks in deep learning, did his PhD under Yeshua Bengio. He likely would have continued being a researcher in the university but after that discovery, companies like Google, DeepMind started bidding for him.

 He got an offer of around $1m; that's like 20 times what he could possibly hope to start off with had he stayed in academia. The guy just left Apple recently (he is the Apple director you probably heard of in the news that left Apple for not wanting to go back to office).
 
 Academia generally has never been very deliberate about rewarding talents. In fact, these days, you find a lot of science professors holding positions in Big tech or private research companies.

 If you put in all those years and efforts in tech, na Director or Senior leadership status na 😩. We are talking 20x to 50x here 🤦🏽‍♂️

I have a problem working with aws lambda function
 
 I have connected my lambda function to github with code build and everything seems fine with the codebuild and deployment however I have multiple python files in my project. 
 So I tried importing functions from my other scripts from the lambda_function script
 
  ```from script import my_func``` 
 
  but it throw error say 
 ""No module named"

"
11660,6/19/22,11:31 AM , +234 701 047 4062," You mean I should add
___init___.py to the folder?
 
 I read on stack overflow that I should keep all my dependency scripts in a folder that contains ___init___.py
 
 Something like this
 
 project directory
 			lambda_function.py
 			utility_folder
 						___init___.py
 						script.py
 
 
 
 But it still didn't work
"

"

1. Try importing with src.path.to.function
 
 Like
  from src.script import *
 
 If it doesn't work or you receive no module named _src_ 
 
 2. Try adding the parent directory to path.
 
 Before the import line
 
 Add
 
 Import sys
 Sys.path.append('path to parent directory')

11674,6/20/22,1:34 AM , S+N Ayoade," Good morning night Owls,

 So I’ve been battling with this Covid data for a while now.
 
 Apparently, the Repatriated Travellers ( a state in Canada) has no value in the longitude and latitude columns and it’s affecting plotting the data on a map.
 
 I went back to power query to generate a new long and lat column for the entire data and set the value of any missing province for both long and lat to be 0.0 but it’s coming out as just 0 alone.
 
 I’ve tried to use use “0.0” but that also is coming out with quote.
 
 What’s the best way to get 0.0 for those rows missing long and lat values 🥺
 
 Thank you

 You cannot treat lat and long values as normal numeric data where you can just fill empty columns with any number.
 
 
 Every lat and long number you have in your data is referencing a place on the Earth including Lat 0.0 and Long 0.0
 
 Lat 0.0 and Long 0.0 is a place on the earth which is not Canada. 
 
 
 The best thing you have to do is check if the province exist and then look for the lat and long through research

11794,6/20/22,3:17 PM , +234 703 047 1536," My option 2 would be.

 Plot the data on the map correctly. Create a different visualization (text) to explain    the outlier (Repi Traveller)
"
11795,6/20/22,3:18 PM , +234 703 047 1536," The best option would be to remove the data since it doesnt represent any location on Earth and everything Ope said as Option 1.
"
11796,6/20/22,3:19 PM , S+N Ayoade," Looking at option 2, it’s very unlikely to know which province the RT people are from..

 It could be from all the Province or few of the province
"
11797,6/20/22,3:22 PM , S+N Ayoade," I think this is what @2347030471536 also suggested.

 To fully automate the process, I will have to do a macro stuff to be removing RT people every time the data is refreshed 🥺

 There’s been a recent Data battle around MDS it’s not becoming a Us against them convo 😂. 
 
 A school of thought believe MDS was sold as a marketing strategy between some companies and VCs (Amplify Partners they say and many others) and it was well positioned and bought well. This is the folks that believe MDS is just unbundling what has existed before. 
 
 Another sets looking for how to eat the National cake of MDS by looking for available feature to build a startup on 😂. 
 
 It’s really an interesting time in the space 😂

"
11844,6/20/22,6:31 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," No doubt MDS have a bottleneck join issue with the rise of various tools.  

 Though I still believe the ROI of MDS is great for companies sha because it’s basically help them stand a Data infrastructure without heavy resource and technical capabilities, and no doubt there’s risk of increased technical debts if not properly done.
"
11845,6/20/22,6:34 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I don't think one can debate the value when you consider where things are coming from.

 In both instances it’s all your choice. Nothing like best left to me because they all have their strength and weakness. 
 
 So go for any tool that fit your use case. Viz tool for reporting;
 
 Power BI
 Tableau
 Google Data Studio
 Quicksight 
 Looker
 Metabase
 Lightdash
 
 Etc.

 Is an Interview Panel worth it?
 
 Do the Big Tech still do it?

"

"

"
12034,6/21/22,6:02 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Yeah. Moreover Big Tech hire for very narrow set of capabilities. You have very large teams, with each individual contributor doing just a small portion of the work.
"
12035,6/21/22,6:03 PM , +234 816 484 7452," Exactly 
The change can start with them 😅

12087,6/22/22,8:02 AM , +234 708 145 1890," Hmmnnn...

 Firstly, I volunteer, get involved in social impact organisations and events.
 
 I think all you need to do is; is there a need around you? 
 Can you fix it? If yes, go ahead and get started.
 If no, what can you do about it.
 
 Making awareness is part of giving back.
 
 This WhatsApp group is a form of giving back by the Admins.
 
 @2348120919501 runs a foundation for kids,
 @2347038065681 does YouTube videos to teach us about Finance (very very helpful),
 @2347033167142 does free SQL and R training from time to time.
 
 Many times, giving back doesn't have to be big and loud, it's starts from the little things.
 
 NYSC is a great avenue to give back.

12198,6/22/22,3:49 PM , +234 818 047 2075, my team wants to get visibility into the ETL process to avoid downstream issues with reports. So we need to create a log table that will contain the following columns
12199,6/22/22,3:53 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Hmmnnn... I guess the flow part is covered, the main thing is the log table.
"
12200,6/22/22,3:55 PM , +234 708 145 1890," You can create your Log table in your db, and add steps that will update the table using SQL Query at each step of iteration.

 I hope you have Power Automate Premium so you can connect with a db. If not, then maybe you should do SharePoint List.
"
12201,6/22/22,4:06 PM , +234 818 047 2075," The power automate part is sorted. It is the SSIS part that we need help. Do you have a sample data flow you have created or useful resources?
"
12202,6/22/22,4:09 PM , +234 706 057 7846," In fact, your power Automate flow doesn't have to wait till every morning. It can trigger the moment a new record lands on the table.

 Now to the ETL process.
"
12203,6/22/22,4:12 PM , +234 708 145 1890," I figured SSIS should have a log for every ETL process that it runs.

"
12211,6/22/22,4:38 PM , +234 708 145 1890," You can add that manually.

 By creating a job that will update the log table with the extra detail that you need.
 
 Once the ETL process is done, the SSIS job will run and insert statement
"
12212,6/22/22,4:39 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Exactly...

 Just that this might be more stressful compared to the first. Which ever way boss.

"
12214,6/22/22,4:40 PM , +234 818 047 2075," I think the first now makes sense. Since we can update the table
"
12215,6/22/22,4:40 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Exactly what I think too.
"
12216,6/22/22,4:53 PM , +234 703 316 7142," There should be a way to fetch that from SSIS logs since it's part of what it reports when migrating the data.

 We moved to telegram and activity dropped to almost 0%😅. We have a slack channel that just chilling.  I check in daily on slack because I’ve very active there because of other communities I’m in but nothing 😀. 
 
 The only option now is to do constant pruning of the group to remove those that probably don’t need it group or inactive (metrics definition for inactivity is where the challenge will be but we will figure something out) to allow new entrants who may need it.

1. Get data over a period and  track if spend of certain customers is dropping. For customers who their value is dropping, I will check if they have given any negative feedback on our services or if there has been some downtime that has impacted them. Based on all that I can take specific actions. 
 2. Check onboarding data for my clients. Check company size or use a proxy. Then compute an estimated expected spend for the customers and compare to what they are currently spending. Where the gap is high, we can get any additional info of how to increase the spend of those clients.

"
12375,6/23/22,3:12 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," It depends on what they want to optimize on for the credit risk model. 

 Tagging all the bosses of credit risk @2348163815935 @2348167187102 @2348168847243 et. all
"
12376,6/23/22,3:13 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Thanks boss. The goal is just to know if the company is doing well enough to be given money (loan)
"
12377,6/23/22,3:13 PM , +234 812 216 8133," To rephrase, would you give a lending company your money as a loan with a default rate of 15%?
"
12378,6/23/22,3:14 PM , +234 904 894 6475," There are no hard and fast rules, but 15% looks too high. What you should be interested in finding is the company's exposure at default for a given threshold.
"
12379,6/23/22,3:14 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Considering you need to make your money back + interest

"
12389,6/23/22,3:24 PM , Abraham Musa," Hmmm.. @2349048946475 , do you have an idea of what default rates look like for an average naija company? 🤔🤔
"
12390,6/23/22,3:26 PM , Abraham Musa," Might be arguably but I think average NG lending companies have rates higher than that. Even few global companies struggle with 5 to 10%.

"
12407,6/23/22,3:44 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I’m just curious what’s the least default rate you work with even with your domain knowledge of various comrade for 9ja 😂
"
12408,6/23/22,3:48 PM , Abraham Musa," Oh... I think the least I can remember should be around 20ish for models I've built oo. But my former employer has something much better. I think around 10ish.

12422,6/23/22,4:03 PM , +234 814 524 2333," One of the major problem here is that; most focus on assessing the propensity of an individual to pay back and do little to nothing around their ability to pay back.
"
12423,6/23/22,4:04 PM , +234 814 524 2333," To really drive the rate down, you need to be building/optimizing solutions to address this two topics.

"

"

"
12462,6/23/22,6:45 PM , Abraham Musa," Nah. This is my first time.
"
12463,6/23/22,6:45 PM , +234 806 842 8052," I was asking because it’s not exactly best practice to build LookML dashboards or create derived tables in LookML.
"
12464,6/23/22,6:46 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," 💯
"
12465,6/23/22,6:48 PM , +234 806 842 8052," Lookml dashboards are never dynamic. You might find a template in their documentation but since dashboards are not monolithic or in the same, consistent format, building a template for one dashboard may not be the best use of time.
"
12466,6/23/22,6:49 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Curious what’s the stack like that influence what you want to build?
"
12467,6/23/22,6:49 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," 🙌🙌🙌🙌
"
12468,6/23/22,6:51 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Since they don’t have dbt , I think he would have to write the LookML temporarily to create the needed explores, and also aware of the limitations that comes the creating PDTs for downstream usage
"
12469,6/23/22,6:51 PM , +234 806 842 8052," This is my guess. And since PDT is involved, maybe a heavy model that requires regular refresh based on timestamp.
"
12470,6/23/22,6:51 PM , Abraham Musa," Yeah. Bigquery to Looker.
"
12471,6/23/22,6:53 PM , Abraham Musa," Yeah. I'm told there's restriction to the native SQL you create within a single view. Also, for now you can read from BQ to looker but reverse not possible.
"
12472,6/23/22,6:54 PM , Abraham Musa," BTW, does BQ have some form of scheduling for SQL codes?
"
12473,6/23/22,6:54 PM , Abraham Musa," Is that what dbt does?🤔
"
12474,6/23/22,6:54 PM , +234 806 842 8052," @2348163815935 you can create derived tables and add the triggers that fit your objective. It could be time triggers. That’s literally what makes a PDT. You can reference the PDT in other views using {example.SQL_TABLE_NAME}
"
12475,6/23/22,6:55 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Do that within Looker using triggers
"
12476,6/23/22,6:55 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Here @2348163815935
"
12477,6/23/22,6:56 PM , Abraham Musa," Okay. Thanks both. Any need I should be concerned about the first statement? I wonder how much of a processing capacity looker has backend. 🤔
"
12478,6/23/22,6:56 PM , Abraham Musa," Or is it best to break into subsequent derived views?🤔🤔
"
12479,6/23/22,6:57 PM , +234 806 842 8052," Naaa. Looker is good. The only think you might worry about is query run time
"
12480,6/23/22,6:57 PM , Abraham Musa," Yeah. Trying to run one colleague dashboard. Was very slow mehn.
"
12481,6/23/22,6:58 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You can use looker to do it. The only challenge will be with build that with PDT which is why it’s best practice as @2348068428052 suggested to push some transformation upstream with a tool like dbt. So Looker only reference a transformed model view
"
12482,6/23/22,6:59 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," *build time
"
12483,6/23/22,6:59 PM , +234 806 842 8052," That might be worse since you’re creating a PDT. You can make an incremental PDT so it doesn’t rebuild your table every time it runs. It can just add the new fields from BQ. This would reduce query run time. If you have an admin access, you can view your looker usage and query run times and use that view to adjust and optimize accordingly
"
12484,6/23/22,7:00 PM , Abraham Musa," Okay. Super useful details guys. Any thoughts on this?
"
12485,6/23/22,7:02 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," That’s why I ask if you’ve written LookML before. 

 
 You can check their docs if there’s a template you can leverage on, however it will be dependent on the metrics or what need to be created downstream which will influence how you write your LookML and necessary conditions you enforce.
"
12486,6/23/22,7:02 PM , +234 806 842 8052," I usually don’t subscribe to LookML dashboard 😂. But you can also create one dashboard and if you have data leaders in the department of your stakeholders, you can ask them to recreate from the one you’ve created. The whole point of using Looker is for data democratization. Let the stakeholders interact with the dashboards and make their own.
"
12487,6/23/22,7:04 PM , Abraham Musa," Alright. Thanks @2348108522573 and @2348068428052. Really appreciate.
"
12488,6/23/22,7:06 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," So check out the following to give you more direction from Looker docs 

 📌 PDTs 
 📌 Incremental PDTs 
 📌 triggers and how to set it 
 📌 LookML and explores 
 
 I believe you should have an idea of where to go from there leveraging on the downstream users.
"
12489,6/23/22,7:06 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Are you the one that want to consume the dashboard or you are creating it for stakeholders?
"
12490,6/23/22,7:06 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Do they know how to use Looker explores at all?
"
12491,6/23/22,7:08 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi, https
12492,6/23/22,7:11 PM , Abraham Musa," It's sort of mixed actually.  Once I'm done with my work, Data Scientist can track metrics on the model he/she built (I have all those logic defined, like sales rate etc), stakeholders can also play around with explores and build whatever kinda visualisation they like.

 In SQL
"
12556,6/24/22,1:10 AM , S+N Ayoade," How are you using the two ?

 As filter or as value ?
"
12557,6/24/22,1:10 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," = 'NULL' mean the field is a string not the proper NULL data which will return empty if you filter by *IS NULL* command
"
12558,6/24/22,1:11 AM , S+N Ayoade," Exactly..

 Why we need to know how the chief plans to use it
"
12559,6/24/22,1:11 AM , +234 816 424 7582," Filter...

 I want to filter all NULL values in a Column
"
12560,6/24/22,1:12 AM , S+N Ayoade," Is null is what we work..

 = NULL won’t work
"
12561,6/24/22,1:12 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You can use both to check because some data aren't properly stored. Some will save NULL as string
"
12562,6/24/22,1:12 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Both can work depending on the data

 = ""NULL"" maybe not =NULL literally
"

"
12564,6/24/22,1:15 AM , +234 816 424 7582," Oh ...ok...you mean purposely entering a NULL into a column I'll use = 
= NULL ❌
 
 While for filtering emptys I'll use IS?

"
12566,6/24/22,1:17 AM , +234 816 424 7582," One is a string while the other is literally empty Sir?
"
12567,6/24/22,1:18 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," For some data quality issues, it's possible to have data stored as a NULL literal (This is what the IS condition will work on) and NULL string (IS condition won't work on this because it's a string, so you filter like a string =""NULL""). Empty string can be filtered with =''
"
12568,6/24/22,1:19 AM , +234 706 439 6712," When u have entries that are named NULL in your table 
 Right?
 
 Den u can use = 'NULL' ..... ( string values ) 
 
 but if ur solely interested in returning  'empty' cells or unknown values,  then use IS NULL  , that's how it's done.
"
12569,6/24/22,1:19 AM , +234 814 592 6677," IS NULL is ok and just as he said some field may look null but just blank space  and by that you won't be able to retrieve those ones as null 

 I agree with IS NULL, but you could also check the entities if there are some looks null but blank space 
 Thank you.
"
12570,6/24/22,1:19 AM , S+N Ayoade," “NULL” is already a value just like “Chibuike” while NULL is means it doesn’t have a value.

 So if you filter by IS NULL, you’ll only get those rows that doesn’t have *values* but if your filter by = “NULL” it’s not different front when your filtering by = “Chibuike”
"
12571,6/24/22,1:20 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," IS NULL ✅

Thanks for the recommendation @2347038065681
 
 I have this Python code that receives data from a spreadsheet, performs some tasks and returns an output.
 
 But I now need the Python code to automatically run based on a trigger (which I'd soon talk about). So I'm thinking hosting the code on the cloud will be a good option since the trigger can happen at any time and my local machine is not always turned on to run the code. 
 
 Now the trigger for the code to run is when a new entry enters the Google Sheet. The entry comes from a form online. So when a person fills the form, the Google Sheet is updated with a new entry (or row) and I want that activity to trigger the Python code to automatically run using that new data.
 
 
 I'd appreciate advice from anyone. Would be nice if you have done something similar.

If it is hosted on a windows server, you can try task scheduler. It can run every 1 or 5 minutes. I think you need to save the python script as a batch file .bat. if it is a Linux server,  I think you need to use cron. Hope this helps

 I also believe the task can be done entirely in Google sheets. Using .JS in scripts editor.
 
 Another interesting thing is there might be custom apps that do what she wants in Google sheet. You can check the google sheets apps.
 
 But if it's not a must to use google sheet, & you have a MS license; Power Automate is the way to go.

"
12716,6/24/22,11:41 AM , +234 708 145 1890," I am trying to think of how this will work.

 The task scheduler will run the the python script every 1min (just saying this).
 
 The python script will connect to the google sheet, check if there's a new record and update accordingly.
 
 That's the flow right? 
 
 This actually makes sense. 
 
 There are googlesheets modules in python, but she will need to create a googlesheet API using google developer console.

 Before and when applying, have it in mind that you have to deliver on your KPIs.

 I have a question
 What did you use for those colors bounding each visual?
 Shape and color or what?
"
13228,6/29/22,8:36 AM , +234 810 644 0791," Great.
I have a question though,
 The confirmed cases is not up to a billion, but your chat is showing it to be 75Billion in 2022 and other charts except the bar chart.

"
13245,6/29/22,11:39 AM , +234 810 831 6393, I had the same issues while I used to build a Power BI dashboard with live data on Covid
13246,6/29/22,11:46 AM , +234 814 113 9601," Nice dashboard. However, one thing you should know about the JHU covid 19 data is that the number of cases and deaths are cumulated continuously on a daily basis per country. (E.g. on the 1st day in the dataset, confirmed cases could be 10, while on the 10th day, the confirmed cases could be 1000. What you should know is that the 10th day value is cumulative of confirmed cases from day 1 through day 10). This explains your very high numbers (E.g. We didnt have 433 mio deaths in the USA). I hope this helps
"
13247,6/29/22,11:47 AM , S+N Ayoade," Thanks for this.

 @2347060577846 mentioned this too..
 
 Any ways to go around this ?
"
13248,6/29/22,11:49 AM , +234 814 113 9601," I used tableau to visualize this and had to write some formulas to get the most recent value per country.
"
13249,6/29/22,11:50 AM , +234 906 092 6282," On point. 
"
13250,6/29/22,11:51 AM , +234 906 092 6282," And I think Power BI has a custom visual for that
"
13251,6/29/22,11:51 AM , +234 814 113 9601," Exactly, allows you see how the value progressed.
"
13252,6/29/22,11:51 AM , +234 906 092 6282," Yep
"
13253,6/29/22,11:52 AM , S+N Ayoade," Can you share?
"
13254,6/29/22,11:53 AM , +234 814 113 9601," I dont have it rn. I'd share it later today once I have it on hand
"
13255,6/29/22,11:53 AM , +234 706 057 7846," It is a cumulative time series data. It will tell you the overall value as at a particular day, month, and year.
Funny enough, that column in its cumulative nature is best for race bar chart. An animated visual
 
 That data will not make sense until you apply day, month, and year filter.
"
13256,6/29/22,11:54 AM , S+N Ayoade," I have the three on the dashboard for filtering..
"
13257,6/29/22,11:55 AM , +234 706 057 7846," Another way to do this even in Excel is to create a new column on the consolidated data sheet, then subtract the column above from the next one. E.g. B2"

"
13265,6/29/22,12:17 PM , +234 706 057 7846," The data is a ""Wide"" data and time series. meaning you have more columns than rows. in this case we have about 280 rows and around 884 columns (the columns keep growing). The values are also reported in cummulative. e.g. yesterday's value for Nigeria will be total reported COVID"
13266,6/29/22,12:18 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Ok got it
"

"
13272,6/29/22,12:25 PM , +234 810 831 6393," Then you either use the suggestions of @2347060577846 or you use slicers to drill down on actual figure. the figures/values. I no know Tabluea that much, but I guess I'm able to do it better in PBI
"
13273,6/29/22,12:28 PM , +234 810 831 6393," With *custom date table* in PBI, you can use write DAX functions to get the actual figures. But @2347060577846's suggestion should be about the most optimized approach. It'll save you a lot of time and explanations.

 When automating processes, you would always want to have validation check points, and if it fails validation, the automation doesn't proceed to the next step

I guess the other issue that it helps me resolve is with commitment.  I am good at learning things on the go especially if I am going to use them immediately at work. Azure is necessary for me at the moment but makes sense to have it.
 
 Get a Pad and write down why this certification is important to you now.

"
13483,6/30/22,1:49 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Okay. So make a list of the things you believe are important for your work today and will be necessary for your work tomorrow.
things ahead of it.
 
 Comprehensive list.
 
 Tech skills
 Soft skills
 Adjacent skills
 
 
 Then assign priority numbers to them.
"
13484,6/30/22,1:52 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Ok thanks. 

 But what about implementation?
"
13485,6/30/22,2:21 PM , +234 703 806 5681," So start with what's most important and work downwards to the least important.

 While prioritising, you want to balance the ""need now"" with the ""need in the future"" especially when you consider your next role (in or outside the firm) and how soon you want to get there.
"
13486,6/30/22,2:23 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Focus on the priority tasks that will move the needle and give them more attention.

 Then move to the next item.
 
 If Azure falls in the upper part of your list, then you'll get to it.
 
 And if it falls in the lower side of your list then you'll get to it later.
 
 Sometimes a lack of desire simply means something is not a priority yet and you can spend that time doing the stuff that matters.

"
13523,7/1/22,10:11 AM , +234 703 316 7142," To get the transactions of the top customer, you can use a window function to get the total for each customer in the transaction table together with rank to get the top 1 customer
"
13524,7/1/22,10:11 AM , +234 818 047 2075," Omo this is so interesting. Been doing the math for last 5 minutes 😂. It is true o. But is this something that is unique to circles and not obtainable for a shape such as square 🤔
"
13525,7/1/22,10:17 AM , +234 703 316 7142," In this context, a pizza should more be considered as a Cylinder and not a cycle cos it's a solid shape. A circle is a plane shape, so the maths done here should be volume and not surface area.

 The height of the pizza also matter but the guy don collect 4 pizzas already 😅
"
13526,7/1/22,10:18 AM , +234 708 145 1890," So, we should take into account whether it's a thin crust or thick crust.
"
13527,7/1/22,10:20 AM , +234 818 047 2075," But I don't think volume will change anything om except the heights are significantly different. Seems the 5 inch will always fall short. Even when you try for other shapes e.g. square. Still trying to understand this honestly.
"
13528,7/1/22,10:20 AM , +234 703 316 7142," Exactly
"
13529,7/1/22,10:22 AM , +234 814 669 0593," More like a sphere. Though not perfect. Its volume can be calculated using integration using the vertical slice approach.
"
13530,7/1/22,10:23 AM , +234 708 145 1890," A sphere?

 I think I disagree.
"
13531,7/1/22,10:23 AM , +234 703 316 7142," Don't make this harder than it seems 🤣
"
13532,7/1/22,10:24 AM , +234 814 669 0593," A cylinder has a vertical height..
"
13533,7/1/22,10:24 AM , +234 708 145 1890," Even as a cylinder gan, it's is not perfect

"
13535,7/1/22,10:25 AM , +234 703 316 7142," He is not saying a sphere though, he is just considering taking the integration over a particular region of a sphere.
"
13536,7/1/22,10:25 AM , +234 814 669 0593," So, it is best to calculate the volume of the pizza through Integration.  

 The vertical slice method should work
"
13537,7/1/22,10:26 AM , +234 708 145 1890," Ohh... ohkay.

 I think this is where I alight from this bus 😂

13543,7/1/22,10:32 AM , +234 813 151 7157," I feel a simple approach would still be a cylinder that approximates the crust thickness to be the height (even though it's not even across) of the hypothetical cylinder.

"
13551,7/1/22,10:34 AM , +234 814 669 0593," True but Integration is still a form of approximation

"
13568,7/1/22,10:43 AM , +234 814 669 0593," Not that per say 

 In other to establish the formula,  you need to differentiate using first principle.  Along the way you have to apply binomial theorem to expand and then simplify.

13573,7/1/22,10:45 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," That’s going through 1st principle @2347081451890  mentioned. 

 You don’t have to always go through 1st principle when you can leverage on standard formula for integration and differentiation. Though in the instance of this pizza 1st principle looks like the way out
"
13574,7/1/22,10:50 AM , +234 814 669 0593," Yeah
"
13575,7/1/22,10:53 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Yeah yeah
"
13576,7/1/22,11:03 AM , +234 814 669 0593," The first principle;
I was talking about first principle
 
 Given a differentiable function f(x), its derivatives is given as 
 
 
 
 However, there is no definite second principle. There are several other rules used to differentiate more complex functions. They can be proved using the first principle .
 
 My POV though.

"
13598,7/1/22,12:35 PM , +234 906 092 6282," Do you know what I've observed?
Learning SQL first will make life easier as a data analyst.

 Look at R, Tableau, and Power Query...

"
13606,7/1/22,12:41 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Very understandable. 

 Depending on your role and how things are structured in your team some DAs don’t even use SQL at all (maybe just Excel and Viz tool). 
 
 Just as @2349060926282  explained understanding SQL help you understand data relationship which is fundamental across all tools

 The koko is to understand what you need to get the job done and add value. No one cares about the tool but are you adding value and if it’s Excel that does the job you aren’t inferior as a Data Analyst
"
13611,7/1/22,12:44 PM , +234 810 878 6913," I go is to be a Data Engineer, but I believe being a Data Analyst will be a building block for me, or what do you guys think?

"
13614,7/1/22,12:46 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Not necessarily. 

 You can aim to be a Data Engineer from scratch and you can also choose to start out from DA and transition. It’s very easy for a DA to move to DE
"
13615,7/1/22,12:46 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," *A good DA
"
13616,7/1/22,12:48 PM , +234 812 178 9229," Static Data are mostly stored as excel files.  But what about dynamic data in which thousands of data are generated within a minute which is  beyond excel files (csv  , xlxs .. ) , that's where SQL comes in , to query Data from Data bases into power BI. 

 Imagine you going to market to get yam and melon to prepare pounded yam, you have to communicate with the seller about what you need and not all item in the market, 
 
 this is Akin to how RDB , SQL and Power BI works . 
 
 Relational Database is the market , you communicate with the seller to get what you need via SQL ( I need this row and column ) and you take it home for Use Power BI .
"
13617,7/1/22,12:48 PM , +234 905 937 1240," Awesome explanation

"
13623,7/1/22,12:51 PM , +234 905 937 1240," What about Analytical engineering?
"
13624,7/1/22,12:53 PM , +234 704 649 8585," Data engineering is more of programming than visualization?
"
13625,7/1/22,12:53 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," That’s the reality. Yes, they are in crazy demand more than other aspect of Data roles and will continue to be based on their strategic position in the Data hierarchy. If it’s something you enjoy explore it if not just enjoy DA and DS which will also continue to be in demand.

"
13664,7/1/22,1:16 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," The North Star will be dependent on the state of the company and what is important to them at that point. So it’s not a fixed metric
"
13665,7/1/22,1:16 PM , +234 909 757 7916," Say it is in the growth stage

13666,7/1/22,1:16 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Are they starting out or retention stage or growth stage or profitability

Just a little reminder👀

13683,7/1/22,1:20 PM , +234 909 757 7916," And you want people to keep using the app

13684,7/1/22,1:20 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Study tinder and see if you can find something
"
13685,7/1/22,1:20 PM , +234 812 216 8133," To be honest. Except you want the number of registered users ad your metric, it would be hard to track successful matches o
"
13686,7/1/22,1:21 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," I think some drop a referral bonus or something for successful match that lead to a proper date. 

 There’s this great movie on Netflix on similar logic.
"
13687,7/1/22,1:21 PM , +234 909 757 7916," Except we are just concerned that matching on the app is all we need and the rest isn't out business

"
13695,7/1/22,1:23 PM , +234 909 757 7916," I think what they are concerned about is matches on the app and not necessarily personal connections right?
"
13696,7/1/22,1:24 PM , +234 812 216 8133," That would be a false metric oh. What if I just dey catch cruise dey randomly match with every tom and Jerry?
"
13697,7/1/22,1:24 PM , +234 812 216 8133," You actually need to explain what you mean my ""matches on the app""

"
13701,7/1/22,1:25 PM , +234 812 216 8133," You can't know this except you're privy to their conversation which is not nice as per data privacy ish

13702,7/1/22,1:25 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Na why I say make you explain

13703,7/1/22,1:25 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Okay boss.
"
13704,7/1/22,1:25 PM , +234 909 757 7916," No lol we don't care about if after matching, it don't work out

13706,7/1/22,1:25 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Yeah.
"
13707,7/1/22,1:26 PM , +234 909 757 7916," As long as they were able to find someone on the app
"
13708,7/1/22,1:26 PM , +234 909 757 7916," You get?
"
13709,7/1/22,1:27 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Okay. Let me get you well. I never used a dating app before. so I sign up on the app, I see a variety of babes. Do I need to match before I chat with any of them?
"
13710,7/1/22,1:27 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Or I can chat without matching?
"
13711,7/1/22,1:27 PM , +234 909 757 7916," What I am saying is if I pick Number of Successful matches as the North Star metric, what are the metrics that'd roll up into the North Star
"
13712,7/1/22,1:27 PM , +234 909 757 7916," Yes you need to match
"
13713,7/1/22,1:27 PM , +234 909 757 7916," You like their profile and if they like you back you match
"
13714,7/1/22,1:28 PM , +234 909 757 7916," Then you can talk to them
"
13715,7/1/22,1:28 PM , +234 818 415 3106," you dey work for Tinder ni
"
13716,7/1/22,1:28 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Okay. Make sense now. You can track that but you can't know for sure who just dey catch cruise with the app. Giving a false sense of success
"
13717,7/1/22,1:28 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Alright
"
13718,7/1/22,1:28 PM , +234 909 757 7916," Nah I am working on something

 Nick went on 986 dates and none was a real life match (Love Guaranteed)
"
13721,7/1/22,1:30 PM , +234 909 757 7916," As long as he kept coming back to the app
"
13722,7/1/22,1:30 PM , +234 909 757 7916," I think that's all that matters
"
13723,7/1/22,1:30 PM , S+N Ayoade," How many matches per person before you can classify such person as an outlier ?
"
13724,7/1/22,1:30 PM , +234 818 415 3106," Na why you dey disturb Rex lady

13728,7/1/22,1:31 PM , S+N Ayoade," Comrade, off mic now..

 Don’t disturb my crush please
"
13729,7/1/22,1:32 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You can define your DAU using visit as a well as confirmed matches on the app

"
13740,7/1/22,2:00 PM , +234 904 894 6475, The reason why the pizza is not treated as a cylinder here is because we can consider the cylinder height as a constant for both pizzas. So we can neglect that height and simply work with the cross
13741,7/1/22,2:02 PM , +234 904 894 6475," I respectfully disagree. If you want to think about it conceptually, try to place two pizzas with 5 inch radius side by side into the cross"
13742,7/1/22,2:03 PM , +234 703 160 7868," If you say the app is in the growth stage. I'll be more interested in a metric like  the number of average signups per time.

"
13744,7/1/22,2:11 PM , +234 703 160 7868," I agree with this. It'll be difficult to track successful matches because most users don't usually own up to using such app especially as it's often tied to insinuations of people doing....runs* But if there is an incentive, you can actually get the users who successfully matched to come back and give useful reviews and testimonials on the app.

13760,7/1/22,4:37 PM , +234 805 365 5849," I’ve had this conversation with myself and people before, and what I have decided to do is to focus of problem solving (I hate that this sounds generic). But being able to think up a high level solution and then decompose it into little bits has to be the best skill imo. I believe, even if you can’t solve those small bits, it’s fine. Once that problem solving skill is solid, you can now focus on tooling up to help solve those bits.

13761,7/1/22,4:46 PM , +234 817 925 1327," Hmm.. wonderful

13763,7/1/22,4:53 PM , +234 805 365 5849," I’d say by working on projects/assignment (sorry it sounds generic once again). This is what helped me with R atleast.

"
13833,7/3/22,1:04 PM , +234 703 678 8365," This is where SQL annoys me thoe. Pipes '||' will work somewhere else but only 'CONCAT' will be permitted in another place(engine). You get to another platform and both pipes and concat will work just fine.
"
13834,7/3/22,1:06 PM , S+N Ayoade," I guess that’s why they’re different player.

 What will work on iPhone won’t work on Android.
 
 What you can do with Samsung, you can do with Techno.
 
 No need to be annoyed.
"
13835,7/3/22,1:07 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Same way every other company pay taxes.

 For global companies with operations in Nigeria, tax is charged on income from Nigeria.

13837,7/3/22,1:12 PM , +234 703 678 8365," Oh well, it is what it is. Probably why during recruitment one isn't usually allowed to run the codes. 

 Just write it in whichever engine you think will process it right.
 
 I've gone to a JS inclined interview and psuedocoded in Python because that's what I was comfortable with as at then. I still passed.
"
13838,7/3/22,1:13 PM , S+N Ayoade," For other companies, I know you pay after removing all the expenses from your income.

 Then you pay 5% on the profit.
 
 But I’m lost as to how tech firm go about it..
 
 Take Dataleum for example, it’s not like they need to buy anything to deliver trainings for their student.
 
 How do you think a firm like that go about tax payment ?

 It’s for Software Developers, so don’t be distracted if you don’t have requisite skill sets. Not all opportunities are for you 😊, so continue to grind and build competence one is definitely coming for the Data folks. It’s obvious Nigeria is a pool of talent and opportunities will certainly meet the preparedness one day. 
 
 I just wanted to call that out before someone that’s still trying to build Data competence or something get distracted and adopt the fire brigade approach to start learning DSA. 
 
 Well, sure you can include DSA in your learning roadmap. I believe it’s important.

"
14179,7/5/22,8:21 AM , +234 816 484 7452," You know that in big tech, there’s this part of training in internal tools when you come onboard

"
14182,7/5/22,8:23 AM , +234 802 825 9007," Even though, if you’re extremely good with python without SDE experience it’d be a difficult transition tbh, moreover now gunning for SDE2
"
14183,7/5/22,8:23 AM , +234 816 484 7452," And since it is an hiring event, you may not necessarily know the team you would be joining  till after everything is done

14185,7/5/22,8:24 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," But it will be hard without SDE experience sha 

 I personally will struggle even with my Python knowledge for Data because I don’t have the experience. No doubt if they give me the time I go learn am
"

"
14188,7/5/22,8:25 AM , +234 802 825 9007," Yes the thing is you need various knowledge of other stuff before entering. Say for example you know Kafka very well but Amazon uses another internal tool your knowledge of the internal working of Kafka will give you leverage to grasp the new tool since you have knowledge of internal workings
"
14189,7/5/22,8:25 AM , +234 816 484 7452," Struggling is in the initial stages sha

 After 3 months, you go deliver

14190,7/5/22,8:26 AM , +234 802 825 9007," I don see python code for my life from Senior Guys and I ask myself is this really python? Did I even know python at all? Cos what? Crazy piece of code bro
"
14191,7/5/22,8:26 AM , +234 816 484 7452," The reason I am saying this is because, I have seen guys who are purely Python Devs survive in more crazy roles after getting into big tech
"
14192,7/5/22,8:27 AM , +234 802 825 9007," Internal tools is also one of the disadvantage of working in those big companies, it’d be very hard to fit into other startups if you’ve left there cos you’d have to go learn some tools again
"
14193,7/5/22,8:27 AM , +234 816 484 7452," And everywhere you go, there’s always a Nigerian community there that you can leverage on

"
14201,7/5/22,8:29 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," What @2348028259007 is saying is that it will be obvious you don’t have SDE experience even if you try scale through the DSA. 

 Your chances are very slim almost zero because we have bad guys with SDE experience and who would also be learning DSA to scale through, so why will they give you without the experience the chance?
 
 Which is why I would have advice Data folks to just stay focused 😂
 
 Na turn by turn. Our turn is coming. 
 
 Maybe something to start adding to learning roadmap is DSA so as to be prepared for it when they come because certainly other companies are definitely coming with Amazon interest in Nigeria. 
 
 So guys continue to build and grind.
"
14202,7/5/22,8:32 AM , +234 802 825 9007," Not to be a bearer of bad news but if you’ve not been studying DSA casually before, your chances are almost zero you’d get in, cos people that get into Amazon and big tech company take years to study DSA before they enter. One month is too short to study to enter. But I’d advice people to try it out to get the FAANG interview experience, it’d give you a lot of exposure to be honest. And you’d be motivated to take DSA very serious.
"
14203,7/5/22,8:32 AM , +234 802 825 9007," Tbh you have nothing to lose to give it a try
"
14204,7/5/22,8:32 AM , +234 816 484 7452," But Data folks already have some SDE experience in a way especially DE guys and ML guys.

 Model deployment and all.

14209,7/5/22,8:34 AM , +234 802 825 9007," I’m my honest opinion there are a lot to gain if you try. You get the experience, the exposure and in fact might get the job
"

 The trails period should get you what you need
"
14553,7/5/22,9:39 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," You go manage Power BI like that niyen o. 

 Or explore @2347033877349  advice by ingesting the data to a db, you can quickly setup a BigQuery db or anyone and do the join and transformation there before tapping the output to Power BI
"
14554,7/5/22,9:40 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," With the volume of data you can’t push transformation to the BI layer it’s not optimum, you have to do that upstream. 

 You don’t need anything apart from SQL. 
 
 Bigquery or other db have functions for working with JSON blob

14610,7/6/22,11:16 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Lauren Balik has really been on the neck of MDS. Hers is more from vendetta compared to others that are educational who share insights on where MDS get it wrong 😂. 

 She’s really gunning for destroying MDS guys driving it 😂. 
 
 No doubt like I said there’s lot of impending issues if MDS not properly managed and well thought out but doesn’t 💯 eliminate or mean it doesn’t provide value like Lauren and some others preach. 
 
 The weird thing is some of them preach end of MDS and say welcome to a new tool (market their own eg Coalesce which Lauren herself is recommending, Narrator.ai tool, castle or so by the so called Post MDS preacher founder 😂). 
 
 It’s really an interesting time in the data ecosystem. The important thing is to understand specific data use case for each organization and the best tool that fit into it.

I think people need to continue preaching how MDS has improved their data intelligence process and less of following prevalent media but then prevalent media will still prevail in decision making.😅

 I personally do not think Post MDS will fly, even if it does it won't be as it is preached. But then if it does, Post MDS will still be like MDS because more products will still be created along these lines. 
 
 And with the abundance of tools in MDS, more and more consulting experts like Data Cult and Co will be contracted for needs assessment and recommendation as what tools fit a particular business. 
 
 I also saw the Airbyte critic, Critics are good as it helps them improve on their products but then it paint's an image of a completely bad tool... but then no tool is entirely bad.

14625,7/6/22,11:51 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿

 I love that take which is very true. Looking at the Post MDS submission truly will definitely mimics MDS with new tool evolution.  I like the submission of *Chad Sanderson* which truly explain a major challenge with MDS which is possibility of Data swamp if modeling not taking seriously and the JOIN Problem. 
 
 She really murdered Airbyte in that post which isn’t completely true 😅😅. I’m sure you use Airbyte and I built the stack previously on Airbyte. Definitely like you mentioned there’s always room for improvement but doesn’t mean the tool is terrible like Lauren posed. 
 
 Anyways like Benn Stancil said “More chaos more opportunities and demand for talented folks and more money 💰 “ 
 
 I just don’t like the way they are going about the marketing by totally condemning a stack to sell yours.

 She’s now out to murder everyone in that space. She’s really a force on her own because she dey shake the space for real and she no dey tire 😂😂😂. For 2 months consecutively she was on their case before she started have fans support her that joined the death of MDS crusade.

They usually hold meetup frequently.  In March they scheduled to hold a meetup, Laurel  wasn’t aware because she was part also had like an hangout for her investors and folks too within same period. 

 Local Optimistics folks reach out to her to cancel kinda🥶🥶 as per our event has been announced and we are the big boys and won’t make sense to have conflicting event 😂 (well na me dey put sugar for the gist ).

The MDS may not be the final promised land but it is better than where we are coming from. The chaos in the data space is a good thing because it points to gaps which still need to be improved upon even in the MDS. At the end of the day the data team must deliver value if the team wants to keep their jobs. So whether MDS o or LDS, or LSA just deliver value. That is the main thing.
"
14752,7/6/22,2:40 PM , +234 818 047 2075," One question I am getting asked often by Execs these days is how my projects are either adding to the top line or bottom line. They don't even know the tool stack. I am now having to think through how to track value either from a revenue generation or cost reduction/efficiency perspective. At the end of the day this is what matters. MDS helps to speed up the time to value and in some cases increases value cause it makes some things easier. But you must deliver that value to be relevant one way or the other.
"
14753,7/6/22,3:01 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Totally agree 💯💯

You are right, I see all the attack against MDS. Me sef, I dey use the whole thing catch cruise and at the same time learning as much as I can about the pros and cons.
 
 Time to value generation and initially increased value is actually the strength of what MDS pitch its tenth on. You can literally spin up a whole Data infrastructure that generate value in little time and minimal technical resource.

Please how can I filter off NULL values in my data frame in R?
 
 Is used the is.null() function to check for NULLs but it returned false only for me to find out later that there are NULLs in the dataset.

14803,7/6/22,5:08 PM , +234 803 884 6009," Without the quotes

 It's that you can pick a new package.. Read the documentation and get your work done

"
14907,7/6/22,6:01 PM , +234 904 894 6475," It can be difficult to generalise what mastery of a language or library is. It means different things to different people. For me, one way I know I've mastered a library is when I've gotten well abreast of different alternative techniques to tackle a specific problem and I can justify why I'm choosing one over the others.
"
14908,7/6/22,6:01 PM , +234 809 183 1446," The one I did recently, I was allowed to use stack overflow tho.. but just using the help() function in R was enough for me.

For example I may not know all the complexities of regex but knowing that regex in Python can solve a particular problem comes with experience and some form of mastery. Just my thought.

 I was following the gist one time. Let me look for it.

In this case, and also since it's a categorical column, you can create a new category for missing data and try that.
"
15049,7/7/22,4:17 PM , +234 703 786 9165," I must say that ML is an iterative process and there's no one size fits all, so I'd advise you remove the column and check the impact on your model, replace with a constant value and check, basically try everything you can get your hands on and check the impact and go with the one with the least negative or best impact.

 Basically this is the concept. The tool would record some steps the developer takes to test his/her app (mostly a web app) and when next the developer wants to take those steps again, he/she would just hit 'play'.

 I'm not going to be using the tool tho, the dev team just wants me to setup something that would make their web applications testing easier. Testing is more like making a set of clicks on the web app just to make sure that they didn't break anything or so.  For now, those procedures are done manually.

15236,7/8/22,12:41 PM , +234 703 806 5681," I think she's making a case against adding more tools.

 In the end you have to go down to the unit economics and make a case or whether the value of MDS is making any further addition to the ""insights"" generated for the company.
"
15237,7/8/22,12:41 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Hence, more credit for providers.
"
15238,7/8/22,12:43 PM , +234 703 845 5619," I think She's saying the people who benefit from the MDS pipeline and infrastructure are the cloud providers of those services and not the business that patronises them. 

 She is coming from a standpoint that an infrastructure or pipeline (in this case MDS) does not automatically translate into data insights and business value. 
 
 She also claims that the widespread belief that getting the MDS will automatically bring insights is only half truth and not all the truth.
"
15239,7/8/22,12:46 PM , +234 703 845 5619," IMO, she is also saying half truth because using a traditional infrastructure does not also automatically mean business insights and everyone will agree that the tools/stack do not equal great insights for the business but the brains utilizing these skills. 

 In terms of providers making money, Microsoft and IbM enjoyed monopoly in the infrastructure space for a long time and she didn't complain that businesses was not getting insights from their MS stack. 
 
 she's just making a case that's not valid in my opinion.

Some of the losses will be human related and not tool related. What we need to do is to find out if many companies are having more losses than wins, if they are then MDS is probably broken (dead is such a strong word which only applies if no company is getting value).

 How do we measure this? Remember that business value and success for a business from data is relative and subjective. 
 
 If we say that because some people have losses from MDS then MDS is dead, then we have to also say that losses from traditional stack or Post MDS tools are due to the tools as well and therefore everything is dead, lolz😅😅...

 But  I need a cloud storage facility where each dept can store their separate files
"
15356,7/8/22,5:42 PM , +234 703 845 5619," Okay.. Microsoft One drive, Google drive are easy options
"
15357,7/8/22,5:43 PM , +234 708 145 1890," What email do they use?

 They should already have some for of storage tied to it.

"
15360,7/8/22,5:45 PM , +234 703 952 6987," With ms one drive. If you are in account dept, you can access files from let say sales dept

 And that's not what I want
"
15361,7/8/22,5:45 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Hmmnn... you want each department to have their own secure file storage.

15366,7/8/22,5:47 PM , +234 703 952 6987," Sharing isn't necessary
I use it and its seamless

"
15370,7/8/22,5:48 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Then each email can be used to create their own file storage.
"
15371,7/8/22,5:48 PM , +234 703 952 6987," Okay... I will do research on this
"
15372,7/8/22,5:48 PM , +234 708 145 1890," If sales have their email (Gmail for example) then they surely have a Google drive.
"
15373,7/8/22,5:51 PM , +234 703 952 6987," What if the MD needs a file from sales, how can he get it without necessarily seeking for the sales email?
"
15374,7/8/22,5:52 PM , +234 708 145 1890," So, the MD can be granted Access to all documents before hand.
"
15375,7/8/22,5:53 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Ideally, if these are business emails,
You should have Microsoft SharePoint or Google Suite.
 
 With these two you can have an Admin and that easily share access.
 
 But for a small business, it might too capital intensive.
"
15376,7/8/22,5:55 PM , +234 703 952 6987," I'm actually thinking of Microsoft business 365
"
15377,7/8/22,5:55 PM , +234 708 145 1890," That's the way to go then.
"
15378,7/8/22,5:56 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Check the pricing and see if it's what you want.

 + Uninstall softwares you you don't often use 
 
 +install duplicate file finder, run it to detect and delete all duplicates

15765,7/12/22,2:47 PM , Joe," What I think might work (I run it in my head and it works, it might fail when you use a normal interpreter).

 I'm assuming you can use python.
 
 I would use python string split method. At first, I thought about splitting by hyphen then I saw that some words can have hypen
 
 Then I realized that I don't think there's any English word (I stand to be corrected) that space will follow the hyphen back and front.
 
 
 You should have a list

Yea, this would work, but... it has to be in this format (R and str_extract()) cus i have to pass the regex into another function that uses str_extract() as its backend

 Have you listened to any of his spaces on Twitter?

15874,7/13/22,9:34 AM , +234 816 484 7452," So it is not about bring politics into the group

 Whether you like it or not, you are in Nigeria and we can only hope for a better Nigeria

15875,7/13/22,9:34 AM , +234 903 783 8682," Lol.

15876,7/13/22,9:36 AM , +234 903 783 8682," Continue.

 You'll see the implications soon.
 
 Politics, tribe and religion should be relegated to the background as much as possible in a heterogeneous setting.
"
15877,7/13/22,9:36 AM , +234 816 484 7452," None of this is geared towards causing unnecessary tension

 Instead it is about being informed
 
 No matter the number of lies, there would still be an atom of truth in one place.
 
 So for the fun of it, let’s get this knowledge and information.
 
 What you do with it is *YOUR CHOICE*
"
15878,7/13/22,9:36 AM , +234 909 130 5248," This is cap
"
15879,7/13/22,9:37 AM , +234 903 783 8682," There are already enough outlets for discussing these topics.
"
15880,7/13/22,9:38 AM , +234 816 484 7452," Besides you refer to these things as topics

 Is it not still Data sir
"
15881,7/13/22,9:38 AM , +234 816 484 7452," Is Data not Information
"
15882,7/13/22,9:38 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Why don't you have a PVC?
"
15883,7/13/22,9:38 AM , +234 816 484 7452," What you do with your data is up to you

 How you validate the authenticity of your data is up to you
"
15884,7/13/22,9:39 AM , +234 903 783 8682," I'll keep the reason personal.
"
15885,7/13/22,9:39 AM , +234 816 484 7452," And last time i checked this group is a *YOUNG DATA GROUP*
"
15886,7/13/22,9:39 AM , +234 903 783 8682," Lol. There's sentiment in this data.
"
15887,7/13/22,9:39 AM , +234 816 484 7452," It’s still comes down to your choice sir
"
15888,7/13/22,9:40 AM , +234 816 484 7452," What you do with it
"
15889,7/13/22,9:41 AM , +234 816 484 7452," I don’t like twitter because of the violence but I am still on the platform 

 So I hereby conform to their own rules and policies even if I don’t like the violence because people do business on twitter, education and skills tips are being shared on the platform also
"
15890,7/13/22,9:41 AM , +234 903 783 8682," My own is just that we should please try to avoid bringing politics, tribe and religion into this group as much as possible.

 Everyone should keep their religion, political opinions and tribal sentiments to their self or other groups as much as possible.
"
15891,7/13/22,9:42 AM , +234 816 484 7452," I think you are missing the point sir

 There’s no need for tribe and religion in all this talk
"
15892,7/13/22,9:43 AM , +234 816 484 7452," We are talking about the *STATE OF OUR COUNTRY*
"
15893,7/13/22,9:43 AM , +234 816 484 7452," and you feel it is politics agenda here and there .
"
15894,7/13/22,9:44 AM , +234 816 484 7452," Whether you like it or not

 What you refer to as Politics is what defines the state of our country and day to day lives.
"
15895,7/13/22,9:44 AM , +234 816 484 7452," No one is campaigning for votes here
"
15896,7/13/22,9:44 AM , +234 816 484 7452," No one is pushing one candidate over the other
"
15897,7/13/22,9:45 AM , +234 816 484 7452," We are only playing with data by sharing it
"
15898,7/13/22,9:46 AM , +234 816 484 7452," What you do with it , whether you collect it or not is your own ball game.

 *But we data centric folks, we need so much of this information so we can make better inferences that will spur the right actions from us*
"
15899,7/13/22,9:47 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Be like say you dey debate team for school
"
15900,7/13/22,9:47 AM , +234 816 484 7452," You might not like it but we have found ourselves in such a situation that we live in Nigeria and need as much info/data as possible

15903,7/13/22,9:49 AM , +234 903 783 8682," You know, Nigerian politics can't be more volatile than it is now.

 Many people believe their tribe and/or religion is under attack in this period.
 
 Every statement has the potential to spark tension. And every tension has the potential to escalate quickly.
 
 I just hope you guys get my point.

 Just catching up on the messages 
 
 In all honesty religious and politics related convo can be dicey and can trigger unnecessary tension of We against them, so I understand @2349037838682 concerns as such as much possible candidate related conversations should be avoided 🙏. Sure we can advocate and drop information to nudge everyone to get their PVCs to exercise their franchise and whoever you choose to vote for or why we think a candidate is the savior Nigeria is expecting should be avoided.
 
 No doubt it’s a Data centric group and also doesn’t mean we can’t have conversations outside of Data, however such conversations should be one that won’t trigger unnecessary uproar like religion, ethnicity or politics. 
 
 Don’t forget to get your PVC

 📌 Please as much as possible shrink your CV to 2 pages at max (1 page if possible with proper template). 
 
 📌 For Entry level and anyone who don’t have any prior Data experience, you can create a section called *Project/Portfolio* to highlight all your personal projects. This is another reason you need a portfolio beyond taking courses. 
 
 I see a couple of CVs and I know this folks have the skills to do the job but the CVs communicate otherwise. 
 
 Recruiters will still refer to your resume for any role, don’t let a poor CV reduce your chances. If needed consult a professional to help you work on it if you can’t.

15950,7/13/22,11:15 AM , +234 703 806 5681," Revamps are always necessary.

 Had to do one on mine this holidays sef.
 
 Few things that helped me.
 
 1. Use a blank sheet to chronicle your journey.
 
 
 b. Projects. Use the STAR method. 
 
 c. Extracurricular eg. firm contributions. How did you use your interests and skills to help others grow.
 
 
 2. Take every item in (1) and slot them under job headings.
 
 For example, I've done work in Audit, accounting, forensic, risk management. And data projects. So I created headings for each one.
 
 
 3. Do a search on job titles you're interested in and what skills and tasks are required.
 
 a. Map your discovery to your own experiences.
 
 b. Where are you lagging? Plan to close the gap. 
 
 
 4. Transfer this to your CV. 
 
 a. Summary (may or may not be necessary depending on the years of experience you have).
 
 b. Skills (technical and soft skills related to the role. 
 
 c. Experience
 
 d. Portfolio/Projects (include links to git/medium/wherever you documented) 
 
 e. Education 
 
 f. Certifications and trainings 
 
 g. Achievement
 
 
 5. Items in (4) above can be rearranged to stress what's most relevant to the recruiter. 
 
 You want to put the most important thing at the top. People don't always have time to read the world on your resume lol. 
 
 If you're going to put a summary section (not objective), make sure you stress leadership ability (if it's a managerial or lead role) and the core areas of your expertise. 
 
 
 There are no hard and fast rules to these things tbh, but cv revamps are an ongoing thing in your career.

 @2349037838682, I think you’re being biased with “ being paid to do what he does”.
 
 Just like my other data centric folks have asked, where is the data to support this claim. I will leave it at that.
 
 That’s what investigative journalism is about.
 
 Only he and AriseTV gives Nigeria media hope that truth still exists btw.

 Did I say leading? It's more or less a monopoly. 
 
 
 The interesting part is that ESRI always tries to hide this fact from their users.
 
 Imagine using geopandas under the hood and calling it spatially enabled DataFrames. Laughable, isn't it?
"
16246,7/14/22,3:03 PM , +234 909 431 5803," You want to group the questions into categories?

16247,7/14/22,3:03 PM , +234 706 942 4890," Making alot of user aware that they also rely on opensource might b bad for business

 Is it a bad thing ni ? Why hide it from your user even as a Big company ?
"
16260,7/14/22,3:31 PM , +234 814 669 0593," Commercial products use open source libraries all the time. It is not a big deal.

 
 The crime ESRI commits is they act like they don't.
"
16261,7/14/22,3:32 PM , +234 706 942 4890," ESRI actually tries to simplify a lot of things for its users. 

 also they partner a lot of Government organisations ... who might not that u knw
"
16262,7/14/22,3:32 PM , +234 706 942 4890," so they need to sell the closed source thing

 it was said that due to security reasons

16265,7/14/22,3:35 PM , +234 706 942 4890," they cant allow them use the newer versions yet

16269,7/14/22,3:37 PM , +234 814 669 0593," Anyways, there are some things that are basic. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheels. 
😂😂
 If ESRI don't want to use those tools, they should build theirs from ground up.
"
16270,7/14/22,3:39 PM , +234 903 783 8682," It means they give it another name and make their users think it's something they innovated.
"
16271,7/14/22,3:40 PM , +234 903 783 8682," They mostly only give the packages and modules new names.
"
16272,7/14/22,3:46 PM , +234 903 783 8682," Honestly, their tools aren't that easy to use compared to their open"
16273,7/14/22,3:47 PM , +234 706 942 4890," yes they simplify the code aspect a  lot  to no code
"
16274,7/14/22,3:48 PM , +234 706 942 4890," projection in qgis gives us more window for parameters setting than in arcgis.
"
16275,7/14/22,3:49 PM , +234 903 783 8682," Lol.

 You want to kill ESRI?!
 
 Even giants have their limits. 
 
 Maybe (maybe oo) they can build geopandas by themselves.
 
 But they can never build GDAL by themselves. Never ever!
 
 And GDAL library is the root of all geodata science.
"
16276,7/14/22,3:50 PM , +234 903 783 8682," Talking of projection.

 ESRI uses the common epsg code in their software. Yet they refused to call it epsg code. I think they call it authority code or something.
 
 Very funny people.

"
16292,7/14/22,4:09 PM , +234 903 783 8682," Some companies are still yet to leave python 2.x

 It's not only about security. It's also about the cost of training their staff on the new version and moving legacy code/projects to the new version.
 
 These things cost a lot in a standard enterprise system.

16293,7/14/22,4:10 PM , +234 706 942 4890," yea but thats what they stated as the reason

 Their tableau 💀
"
16393,7/15/22,2:13 AM , +234 903 783 8682," I took some courses in their machine learning track. I can relate.

 However, I think craming happens when you don't understand the concept clearly. Sometimes the instructor's explanation might not be good enough.
"
16394,7/15/22,2:17 AM , +234 903 783 8682," Thanks so much.

 I'll try their platform. If I think I'm not getting value, I'll dump it.

 People know of its existence, unlike solution architects or analytical engineers, and others in that aspect. 
 
"
16399,7/15/22,8:00 AM , +234 814 669 0593," And yes, the ""prediction"" envelope. A lot of fresh data scientists have that issue too. They believe they are coming to import models from sklearn, fit them to data, predict, and voila! Money flows in. 

 If you are lucky (unlucky), you might be doing that. I know people who have been doing that well in their careers.
 
  However, you might be creating complicated models and pipelines and architecture that predict (or __ call __) will be a  stage in your problem.

"
16452,7/15/22,11:10 AM , +234 903 783 8682," Very true.

 Sometimes, I want to pity these politicians because some of these things aren't their fault. And our media is hellbent on turning us against our leaders. They only enjoy pushing bad news.
 
 But then, if these leaders had fixed NTA and other government agencies, we wouldn't have been in this mess.
 
 One bad thing about being a chronic liar and cheat is that one day you'll be telling the truth and no one will want to believe.

 All we do is circled our emotions/feelings and beliefs system.
"
16461,7/15/22,11:22 AM , +234 903 783 8682," Many of our political opinions are based on bias. We might not want to acknowledge it but it's the fact.

 At best, the educated ones try to cosmetize our bias with grammar and vocabulary.
 
 When our preferred candidate errs, we give excuses. When an opponent does a tenth of the same error, we want to crucify him.
 
 Political arguments are laughable to say the least.

 Is there a distinct difference between what's referred to as modeling in PowerBI and building ERDs for databases? Are these just nuances or they're different?

 But I wonder why Python is pushed more than SQL in mainstream media when SQL is mostly used in industry compared to Python for Data Analyst role.
"

"

"

"
16980,7/17/22,12:16 PM , +234 904 894 6475," Depends on the goal. If the goal is to teach kids programming, Python is a good start. If the goal is to get them started in data, Excel. In more powerful ways than we seem to realise, Excel can help strengthen the foundation for reasoning in data.
"
16981,7/17/22,12:17 PM , +234 706 942 4890," Yes i av quillbot but the free one doesn't do much sha.. but if I see sm1 interest won't mind buying a paid one together fr 50$ dats 25 each sha fr  a year
"
16982,7/17/22,12:18 PM , +234 904 894 6475," I should probably say if the goal is to get them started in anything analytical using computers, Excel is an excellent start.
"
16983,7/17/22,12:19 PM , +234 907 510 4857," Finally 

 I’m glad we’re seeing it this way.
 
 I’ve had so many people argue with me that you don’t need Excel for ata analysis.
 
 They end up learning Python and sql first
 
 How about basic excel
"
16984,7/17/22,12:19 PM , +234 817 965 1769," I actually do advocate for Excel FIRST
"
16985,7/17/22,12:21 PM , +234 817 965 1769," I am just thinking that normally in secondary school  curriculum for some private schools, they do include software/ programming though not effective. 
"
16986,7/17/22,12:21 PM , +234 907 510 4857," Thank you for being honest
"
16987,7/17/22,12:23 PM , +234 907 510 4857," They do have programming as part of the curriculum.
The student can just learn Python to strengthen his programming knowledge
 
 If they offer computer studies
 
 Programming is always part of the curriculum.
 
 I had a text book in my SS1 
 
 Trust me university students still use that because it had the basics of programming.
 
 You learn Python, C++ and rest
"

"
16990,7/17/22,12:24 PM , +234 907 510 4857," I feel most people follow the trends instead of learning the process
"
16991,7/17/22,12:25 PM , +234 817 511 5556," Honestly because any standard data analyst course always starts with spreadsheets
"
16992,7/17/22,12:25 PM , +234 817 511 5556," They are always the foundation
"
16993,7/17/22,12:26 PM , +234 817 511 5556," Everything else builds on spreadsheets
"
16994,7/17/22,12:26 PM , +234 703 806 5681," I have a mentee who began learning Python for data analytics. Said she couldn't understand how to tie it into corporate finance.

 I told her to pause first and take the PwC data analysis course.
 It's analytics foundations, excel and power bi.
"
16995,7/17/22,12:26 PM , +234 703 806 5681," *power point
"
16996,7/17/22,12:27 PM , +234 817 511 5556," Exactly because Corporate Finance roles funnily always have Excel skills as a requirement

16999,7/17/22,2:50 PM , Joe," Has anyone here setup a mongoDB replica set locally before? I'm having errors I don't understand and I don't think I'm doing anything wrong (followed a guide). Had to repair installation at one point 

 2) how would you approach parsing a nested JSON with dynamic keys (some of keys has numbers that changes at the end of the string). I have a list of all the variations 
 
 What I'm thinking 
 
 join the keys with a delimiter to become a single string then use regex to find the full string for each key.
 
 How would you solve this ? 🙏🏽

 The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has approved an upward review in the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) from N165 per litre to N179 per litre, effective today (Tuesday).
 
 
 This came after weeks of petrol scarcity resurfaced across the country as fuel retailers were adopting different price bands to force unofficial deregulation attempts.
 
 Already, majority of filling stations in Lagos have adopted different price models. While some filling stations have changed the price on their meters to reflect the current price they are selling at, others have left theirs to show the approved retail price of N165 per litre but were selling above the displayed price.
 
 For instance, the Mobil filling station on Agidingbi sold a litre of petrol at N170 per litre on Friday and that was evidently displayed on their meters.
 
 The development was also the same at Enyo filling station at Chisco bus stop, in Lekki, which now sells for N170 per litre, Eterna filling station at Jankade bus stop, Lekki sells at N180 per litre and Mobil Filing station, by Osapa London, Lekki now selling at N170 per litre.

"

"
17303,7/19/22,11:45 AM , +234 816 484 7452," The best approach would be to spend less on Dev and spend more on Prod. so definitely different entities goes

 So it has to be 2 different entities 
 
 Why because Dev would be everybody playground and can it won’t be handling the main stuff
 
 So if dev is like 40Gb in storage
 
 Prod can have more with SSD reliance .

"
17589,7/20/22,8:29 PM , +234 903 783 8682," I couldn't agree more.

 I got a World Bank project in 2020. It was my first big project.
 
 I learnt so many lessons from that project.
 
 First, I saw the power of a strong online presence. I didn't bid. They came to my DM. Their 'scout' saw my answer to a question on a Facebook group. 
 
 
 2. This is the point I want to emphasize. They signed me as a junior consultant. Fortunately for me, the person signed as the senior consultant couldn't show up. So I had to handle the whole project and I did it fine and smooth.
 
 Thirdly, I learnt the importance of good morals and manners. After signing the project, I learnt that one of the other candidates was disqualified because he showed up at the remote interview with a bare chest. But during my interview, I asked them to give me a moment to dress up properly before turning on my camera.
 
 Normally, I would have been too intimidated to apply for the contract.
  Since then, I've learnt to always shoot my shot.

 I have tried something similar, but we moved to use ClickUp instead of planner.

 Stop calling on Admins to remove scammers, It's a collective responsibility. The method am going to share does more damage to the scammer than ordinary removal.
 
 They used link to join the platform, so it's practically impossible to block scammers from accessing the platform, But there is a way to get hackers account blocked and deactivate.
 
 Now Listen...
 
 1. Click on the offending scam post.
 
 2. Amongst the options that come up click on More.
 
 3. Amongst the next options click on Reply privately.
 
 4. This opens the person’s WhatsApp page.  Click on the phone number at the top.
 
 5 . This opens up his full accounts page, Scroll down to the bottom and click on Report and Block.
 
 If 20 people do this we might be able to sanitise the platform faster. It does more damage to the scammer than ordinary removal.

"
17847,7/22/22,12:29 PM , +234 703 806 5681," But they won't incur liabilities. Their job is to ensure they have enough liquidity to meet the needs of the customers.
"
17848,7/22/22,12:29 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Honestly it sounds like they are unknownkingly running a ponzi
"
17849,7/22/22,12:30 PM , +234 703 806 5681," 😂😂

 It's a B2B2C model
"
17850,7/22/22,12:30 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Employers are the customers technically.
"
17851,7/22/22,12:30 PM , +234 708 675 3621," It's not profitable in the long run
"
17852,7/22/22,12:30 PM , +234 703 806 5681," But the lack of fees makes it difficult to understand how they'll manage a default risk.
"
17853,7/22/22,12:30 PM , +234 812 216 8133," I'm interested in their revenue model because of the zero interest
"
17854,7/22/22,12:31 PM , +234 708 675 3621," What happens if your employer inflow plateau
"
17855,7/22/22,12:31 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Na wettin we dey discuss be this
"
17856,7/22/22,12:32 PM , +234 703 806 5681, Fee based. 250 
17857,7/22/22,12:32 PM , +234 708 675 3621," That would require people withdrawing almost every minute to break even sha
"
17858,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Think they're banking on volume
"
17859,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Might not be the best way to go for a startup
"
17860,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Withdrawal charges won't generate enough to pay salaries talk more other costs. 

 Except they are starting with the model to get users and then later they put charges. Because this model no be am!
"
17861,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 706 439 6712," It's a strategy and a trap
"
17862,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Fees on flutterwave and paystack transactions are low, but they have high volumes
"
17863,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 708 675 3621," With that model yh I think so
"
17864,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Exactly. Since they are new, withdrawal rate would be low
"
17865,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Explain the strategy
"
17866,7/22/22,12:33 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Explain both
"
17867,7/22/22,12:34 PM , +234 812 216 8133," +1
"
17868,7/22/22,12:34 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Copy that.
"
17869,7/22/22,12:35 PM , +234 812 216 8133," This seems to be like a salary backed loan. What happens when an employee defaults?
"
17870,7/22/22,12:36 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Employer default.

 The employer makes the payment, not the employee.
"
17871,7/22/22,12:37 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Now. I'm lost. Are they trying be like Bento? But with an access to 50% of the 50% of your salary?
"
17872,7/22/22,12:37 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Utiva is building something similar too.

 Entrova
"
17873,7/22/22,12:38 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Maybe.

 But Bento also does payroll management.
 
 Like someone suggested on the other group, they need to find another service to render, otherwise they're giving a lot and getting almost nothing back.
"
17874,7/22/22,12:39 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Alright
"
17875,7/22/22,12:39 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Now think as an employer how would this be beneficial for you?
"
17876,7/22/22,12:40 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Beyond staff welfare support, there's the issue of liquidity management esp if you already make Advances and Loans available to your staff.

 Now someone else takes that off your plate and leaves you with more cash in hand to manage other operational activities.
"
17877,7/22/22,12:40 PM , +234 708 675 3621," It's a necessity
"
17878,7/22/22,12:40 PM , +234 703 806 5681," From a finance, working capital point of view.
"
17879,7/22/22,12:40 PM , +234 812 216 8133," Good question
"
17880,7/22/22,12:42 PM , +234 708 675 3621," Wouldn't it make more sense to just leave that to stock brokers, that way things like these are off your plate and you're making a certain level of profit based on the investment portfolio the company has chosen for its employees
"
17881,7/22/22,12:42 PM , +234 803 810 5953, Check out this job at Seplat Energy Plc
17882,7/22/22,12:43 PM , +234 817 511 5556," I'm not sure if I am looking at it from a different perspective but 
"
17883,7/22/22,12:44 PM , +234 817 511 5556," Which means that whether you use the service or not you still get paid whatever is left of your salary at the end of the month
"
17884,7/22/22,12:46 PM , +234 817 511 5556," Technically implying that the money the employer is lending to the employee is what would have been at the end month
"
17885,7/22/22,12:47 PM , +234 909 880 8992," I think there would be a limit to what you can withdraw per month
"
17886,7/22/22,12:54 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Why would a stock broker manage liquidity for a private company?
"
17887,7/22/22,12:54 PM , +234 703 806 5681," 50% of your salary, max. And not more than 50k per time

"
17891,7/22/22,1:02 PM , +234 909 880 8992," The BM is looking a bit risky
Isn't the concept mean to be like getting paid half your salary before you complete the month
 
 In a situation where the employer does not have enough to funds to loan and the employee needs money how will they manage that

 The business idea is actually fantastic, but the model is not clear to me.. And as someone said, it's mostly not gonna be sustainable for long.

 How will this pan out with the case of delayed salaries or even those employers that owe a backlog of salaries? There has to be some sort of guarantee from employers who may default in salary payments.
 I want to believe they'll have other ideas to introduce other product offering to users once they take off successfully.
 
 There is definitely something they're not telling us...
"
17936,7/22/22,6:03 PM , +234 703 806 5681," Point is, they don't need to tell us laslas. It's their business, it's their model, it's their trade secret.

These companies are open to local alternatives when it comes to their major technology applications to reduce that exposure. Looks like there is an emerging market for Nigerian companies building tech products. 🤔 
For example, I know a Nigerian company which has made about 1 billion Naira from building an application which some Nigerian companies were paying over a million dollars for. 
 
 Has anyone noticed this too?

"
18043,7/24/22,2:33 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Any amount they call for you convert it to hourly rate to see if it’s too small or manageable and most importantly you can also evaluate if it’s an opportunity to build your skills and brand in public through sharing knowledge. 

 My first class was 2000/hr in 2018 as an upcoming, today I state my price 🥶. So there are many factor that will influence your rate

 I understand not everyone here were able to attend the dbt meetup  where we add panelist attend to all questions from folks. So I’m blocked my calendar for next weekend for anyone to join to ask any question you have about data. 
 
 What’s going to be flow of the session? It’s just going to be flex and cruise to ask me ANYTHING about data and hopefully I will be able to attend to all.
 
 Don’t miss it.

 Semantic layers is a fraction of Metric layer. 
 
 The basic idea of Metric is to solve one major challenge with most BI tool that tracks metrics. 
 
 Let’s use Power BI where your semantic layer will be where your build your Data model , define all entities and relationships as well as the DAX measures that will be leveraged for reporting. 
 
 As an example, let’s say there is a measure that calculate customers with the highest purchase where there is a measure to do that. 
 
 
 So self service isn’t then self service as proposed which now lead to a new trend called *Headless BI* built on Metrics layer. 
 
 What then is this new paradigm?
 
 There is a single source of truth for all metrics that can be accessed across tools and not locked in by any tool. So see it as Decoupling Power BI where the Data modeling and DAX is separated. 
 
 Data thought leaders believe this new paradigm will solve a lot of issues. 
 
 I hope that help provide more context.
"
18347,7/25/22,3:35 PM , +234 810 831 6393," You can chose the *csv* format, copy the output link, then return to PBI, use the *import from web* option
"
18348,7/25/22,3:40 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," The issue with the current infrastructure with most BI tool is what is called siloed metrics approach. 

 Same way we had the issue of siloed data which was solved leveraging 1 single source of truth for Data. Metrics layer is also targeted to provide 1 single source of truth for metrics.
"
18349,7/25/22,3:41 PM , +234 818 047 2075," Makes sense to me now. Thanks for this. So where does metrics layer now sit if it isn't platform locked?

 BI that don’t have head 
 
 Maybe because metrics consumption for business in the past is situated in the BI layer (the head 😂), now there is no head for metrics definition since the metrics can now be defined upstream in the infrastructure and shared across all tools downstream.

 Infact loading to a db might be an issue.
 
 Have you tried opening the file? it will eat all the RAM space one time 😂
 
 But in a db, you will be fine. You can even optimse the data depending on how it is.

what sort of data structure would you use to store and analyse a transaction network
 
 The only guide I have is if he has done his research on the knowledge/ skills/ abilities he needs to get his dream job , he should work on projects that will showcase the specific skills. 
 
 Especially if he wants to work in a specific industry/ data field. 
 
 And, one way he can find out about the skills he needs to showcase is by reading through job descriptions and openings.

 He published about 3 major papers that led up to the solution of the Poincare conjecture. It took around 3 or 4 years of expert review for his solution to be certified as correct and complete.
 
 But in that period of time, there were other prominent mathematicians (especially from US), who had been racing towards the solution, who tried to discredit him and rubbish his work. Perelman was not a very social mathematician in terms of relating well with other mathematicians, and so most of them treated him like he didn't belong. You know that kind of cult behaviour where people feel someone who isn't in their clique cannot and should not have a seat on the table. It was this kind of behaviour that was the last straw for Perelman.
 
 Imagine trying to run away from so many issues of society and finally you think mathematics is the place where you can hide from all those problems, only to be eventually treated the same way by mathematicians you consider family 🥲
 
 So after solving the Poincare conjecture, Professor Perelman resigned from mathematics work and went back to his village 💀
"

18528,7/26/22,11:14 AM , +234 904 894 6475," Yeah, that's why there's no Nobel prize in mathematics. Mathematics is just one hell of a different field
"
18529,7/26/22,11:15 AM , +234 812 216 8133," So age shouldn't be a barier, some are late bloomers
"
18530,7/26/22,11:15 AM , +234 904 894 6475," Also, I hope you are aware that most of the Nobel prizes are awarded for work that the recipient did many years before?
"
18531,7/26/22,11:16 AM , +234 812 216 8133," Sure. Once your work has passed the review stage which can take years
"
18532,7/26/22,11:19 AM , +234 904 894 6475," For example, Roger Penrose (my favourite cosmologist) got the Nobel prize for discovering that black holes were proof of Einstein's general relativity theory.

 Penrose's work was from the 70s or so.
"
18533,7/26/22,11:20 AM , +234 904 894 6475," Stephen Hawking didn't get a Nobel prize before he died in 2018, because his own aspect of black hole research had not been experimentally verified.

"
18536,7/26/22,11:22 AM , +234 904 894 6475," So I agree, age should not be a barrier. But I think the Field's medal committee just restricted it that way so that there's no confusion as to who to award if the number of deserving mathematicians becomes too high.

 Also, they award it every 4 years, making it the world's most prestigious academic achievement.
"
18537,7/26/22,11:23 AM , +234 703 316 7142," Don't mention😂😂
"
18538,7/26/22,11:23 AM , +234 812 216 8133," True. Sometimes, a research could be well ahead of its time.

"
18540,7/26/22,11:24 AM , +234 904 894 6475," It's not just review. In fact, most times we know that the theories are correct. But in physics, chemistry or medicine, a Nobel prize can only be awarded if there's experimental verification that something works.

 So it's easier or faster to get a Nobel prize in experimental physics than in theoretical physics.
"
18541,7/26/22,11:24 AM , +234 817 511 5556," Somebody tortured me for three straight years 😩

"
18548,7/26/22,11:39 AM , +234 904 894 6475," Part of the reason for this problem is that the world's great mathematicians were those that were trained from great mathematicians too. We have that disconnect over here. 

 Our mathematicians don't tend to have world class mentors. Maybe just very few exceptions, but these ones don't go ahead to further push the boundaries.
 
 Our mathematicians don't get to study in some of the greatest places to get nurtured in rigorous mathematics and meet really great mathematicians, e.g, Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Stanford, etc. If you check most of the Nigerians that make it into prestigious universities, you will find that it's literally all other areas except mathematics. So our mathematicians hardly make it into places where the greatness gets handed down. Kings are raised through kings. The closer you are to one, the better.

 Reach out by calling the HR that sent in the initial offer you rejected asking if the offer is still available. 
 
 HR people don't like to feel defeated. Also, it's stressful and a waste of resources to start looking for another best fit so your offer is usually available for some days after you reject it. 
 
 The worst you can get is a no. But don't ever not reach out. Swallow your pride and reach out ASAP.
"
18847,7/28/22,9:19 PM , +234 703 678 8365," An extra tip I used was that I said  the pay didn't match what I desired as the next step in my career path but I reconsidered and would like to be a part of the team. 

 I eventually got a higher offer when they reached out to accept me.
"
18848,7/28/22,9:20 PM , +234 708 145 1890," Sweet!
"
18849,7/28/22,9:21 PM , +234 814 669 0593," Mail the HR if the offer is still on the table. Tell them you have reconsider and you will like to join them.

"
18856,7/28/22,10:39 PM , +234 909 757 7916," I picked A, I want to see if I am right
"
18857,7/28/22,10:57 PM , +234 703 678 8365," I'm not a product manager but based on my experience carrying out A/B testing, I'd choose A.
"
18858,7/28/22,11:06 PM , +234 904 894 6475," The link between the control (group A) and the treatment (group B) is the homepage. So Option 4 is ruled out.

 Option 1 would have been correct based on above context, but the hypothesis is testing specifically for relationship between commercial content volume and clicks, rather than just homepage views. So option 1 is ruled out. 
 
 For this to work, both treatment and control groups must specifically view the commercial content, then the proportion of clicks is analysed from those views. This makes Option 5 the correct answer.
"
18859,7/28/22,11:15 PM , +234 904 894 6475," I just did a rethink on my last paragraph. 

 Option 3 should be the correct answer because the hypothesis is checking for proportion of clicks with respect to quantity of commercial content. Not with respect to views on commercial content.
 
 Would like to read others' thoughts as well.
"
18860,7/28/22,11:19 PM , +234 703 678 8365," This is convincing as the CTR is a metric that will be used in this experiment.
"
18861,7/29/22,6:48 AM , +234 703 160 7868," I'll pick Option 2. 

 None of the answers are correct.
"
18862,7/29/22,6:52 AM , +234 703 160 7868," This is an ad (commercial content) effectiveness experiment. 

 To likely determine the factor(s) that will lead to fewer clicks through to sponsored pages, you've to establish a baseline in one of the two user groups. If Group A still sees the homepage feed as it is, it means they are the baseline (control group) and won't be exposed to the experiment. Then this leaves you with the users in Group B. It is within this group, you're now able to determine whether there will be a lift or dip in revenue from sponsored content because they're the ones who'll see lesser commercial content (ad). So my answer will be the users in Group B are the ones exposed to the experiment.

 The moment you reject an offer either explicitly by saying No or indirectly via a counter offer in this instance the offer is off the table. 
 
 Going back again definitely is a 50/50 but it put you off as a desperate person when you go back begging for the offer you rejected. It’s the psychology around counter offers
"
18886,7/29/22,10:18 AM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Most won’t even answer you which is why when countering an offer just know it’s a 50/50 they may rescind the offer or accept it. 

 It’s a game of gambling

"
19119,7/30/22,9:13 PM , Opeyemi Fabiyi," Airbyte acquired Grouparoo to give the Reverse ETL folks a chase 😃😃

 
 Google acquired Looker and Datafold (dbt competitor) but developed by Google.  It’s funny Google devs use dbt and not Datafold
 
 I saw on dbt channel one Google guy introduced himself and was like “though we built Datafold but most of my team use dbt😀”
 
 
 What if Microsoft wake up one day and buy all of them over 😃😃?
 
 
 Will the accept?

 Before I carry it to LinkedIn and my other media channels.
 
 And it's because I like you people too much 😉.
 
 It's dividend season in the stock market this month. 
 AND the US stock market had it's best month in July, since November 2020.
 
 This means, people who have been invested so far have enjoyed some big benefits by way of dividends and Naira hedge against inflation. 
 
 Yet, so many of you didn't get in on the action. 
 
 So... I want to teach 10 people how to start investing in stocks this month 
 
 The  *first 5 people* to subscribe will get in at N25,000 only ($35).
 
 This will be a *beginners class*. 
 
 Whether you've bought your first stock (because you guessed at it) or you want to start buying now. 
 
 *It's just N25,000* and it will NEVER be this price again. The going rate in the market for a live class cost at least N150,000 ($200).

 It's still N35,000 for you until 12pm today.
 
 After this you'll buy at N50,000.
 
 Ask yourself if you'd rather not pay less to make more from this stock market that's raising millionaires in this decade? 🤷🏽‍♀️
 
 It's a bear market, this means so much is selling at a discount.
 
 If you learn this now and get in now, you'll basically be giving yourself a Black Friday sale 😂 and making more than those who bought during the boom.

 PayPal > US Bank account > Payoneer > your Nigerian bank 
 
 That’s the withdrawal process
