So as business folks in orgs become more and more data literate, they can use these tools to test their ideas, get initial viable solutions, etc, before assigning or approving projects for technical teams.. In this kind of environment, the value a data scientist will bring in is to extend those ideas with code, use statistics to make reasonable assumptions, and build robust solutions that can be justified with interpretability best practices.",07/05/2022 23:26,Saturday,575,98,11,2022,7,5,Jul

Hence why a school of thoughts believe meta data should be driving Data infrastructure and pipeline to make it easy to fix any pipeline that breaks because proper data governance and definition have been done. So it will be easy to know where to look it any numbers doesn’t add up. Downstream,08/05/2022 12:45,Sunday,374,69,12,2022,8,5,Aug

I don't know if I'm putting it right but here's what I mean.. 1. You apply topic modelling on a large data of text. 2. The original data would have a new column specify the topic class.. 3. From the topics generated, you apply some classification ML to get the probabilities of a document falling in each of the generated topics.. 4. Then the model would be used to predict future data..

They'll go online and read all sorts of stuff and come and complicate simple things for the team.. That's why the best project managers are those that have technical background and later transitioned to project management.. I've met one before. He was such a wonderful person.. He will give you assignment and show you exactly how you'll solve the problem. You'll grow when you work with people like them.. It's a pity that they're few especially in Nigeria where tech is still relatively young.

Test whether the distribution per activity description of hidden semantic information could predict the classes (charity or humanitarian etc). Since the data is about <10^5; Train LDA Model on about 75% of the activity description (randomized sample).. Grab Topic distributions for every activity description using the LDA Model. Use Topic Distributions directly as feature vectors in supervised classification models (random forest preferably) and get F1-score.. Use the same LDA model(same hyperparameters) to get topic distributions for other 30% (unseen data). Run supervised classification models again on the 30% vectors and see if this generalizes.. If the supervised F1-scores on the unseen data generalizes, then you can posit that the 70% topic model has identified latent semantic structure that persists over time in this activity description..

2245,05/12/2022,6:57 PM, +234 816 484 7452," *Data Lake* - This is pretty much or most times an object or cloud storage you use to house data in its raw format. From Structured to semi-structured and unstructured data. The good thing about it is that it accepts data in all format but the downside to it most times is that you don't get the simple advantages you get with a Data Warehouse like querying your data, having ACID BASE transactions and operations with data.. You have to implement data governance and policies yourself so your data lake doesn't become a *DATA SWAMP* .. But these days there are a bunch of technologies out there that helps put in all of these things in place and help implement a good functioning data lake properly. examples are LakeFS which is bring git versioning to Data Environments, some refer to it as the perfect data management tools. Another tool is Delta Lake which is used to upgrade the data lake by making it possible for you to perform ACID BASE transactions on data artefacts in your data lake because you are able to save your structured data as Delta Tables that you can write SQL queries against and also delta lake brings it data governance and management to your data lake because it does versioning out of the box, meta data handling and also keeps the logs of your data artefacts at different point so you are able to perform time travel operations on your data assets. Some other the cool advantages of this is you are able to store your data for long with less cost and you are also able to separate your storage layer from your computing layer in your data environment or infrastructure.",12/05/2022 18:57,Thursday,1598,288,6,2022,12,5,Dec

A LakeHouse is actually *Data Lake + Data Warehouse*. *A lakehouse* builds upon the strength and flaws of these two technologies and concepts.. So Ideally when you use Delta Lake to handle the flaws of a typical data lake, you are actually implementing a Lakehouse..

Remember that the Lakehouse and data lake can handle both batch streaming data.. - Have a cloud or object storage of your choice or any file system that support delta lake. - Spark Environment with Delta Lake Packages and jar configured and installed(So you have access to all of Databricks Delta Lake Capabilities). - So you can code in Pyspark via a jupyter notebook, scalar or any programming language of your choice using the Delta Lake Spark API for the language you prefer.. - LakeFS to bring in git versioning and Data Management to your big data or normal data environment. - Airflow for Workflow Orchestration and Scheduling. - And since it is a Lakehouse, it can speak to other technologies like *dbt* , *Airbyte* etc",12/05/2022 19:12,Thursday,938,159,7,2022,12,5,Dec

Lets me use something small, You are using Postgres for your data warehouse implementation, and your data size is like 100Gb but you know that you hardly query a large part of the data. What you can do here is to have your historical data in a Lakehouse or normal data in parquet format or delta table format hereby shrinking your 100Gb to about 25Gb in parquet but you connect your lakehouse to your Postgres using *parquet_fdw* , So that you can query your red hot data which can be around 5Gb on Postgres and from Postgres environment, you can query your historical data which is 25Gb in size from the data lake or lakehouse",12/05/2022 19:21,Thursday,961,178,7,2022,12,5,Dec

A DS becomes useless if there is no DE or he/she is forced to do DE work , and a DE on the other hand can’t build predictive models which the business need, so they work separately towards a common goal - Using Data to drive value.. I’m working with a client that has the full squad data team - DE/AE/DS/DA/MLOps and I can say everyone’s work complement each other.

2789,5/14/22,10:29 PM, +234 904 894 6475," This is about to be a little long read.. I think the biggest career turnover in the data space happens in data science, unfortunately. And by ""data science"" here, I'm specifically referring to the typical scope of work of a ""data scientist"", because sometimes the term ""data science"" can refer to one entire side of the coin of the data space itself, the other side being data management/governance.. Now, talking about turnover, I've seen that it can be hard to break into data science after the learning journey, even harder to succeed in the role, and hardest to sustain success and keep up the progression of career growth.. Most people give up at Stage 1. Stage 2 is where some others come to the objective realisation that data science isn't the best area for them to make impact with data. Stage 3 is where you see the rest of the pivot where people permanently ditch DS for other data areas such as DA or DE, or even completely outside such as product or engineering.. I've been opportune to function across DA, DS, DE, sometimes focusing on one individual area and other times doing a combination, but I've spent the shortest time doing data engineering and the longest doing data science. In my experience across the 3 areas, it's easy to understand why data science gets the most turnover. Data science is the most hyped amongst all the data specialisations. And, if you ask me the hype is well worth it – data science literally sits at the center of decision optimisation and automation for orgs that are creating and monetising data value streams.. The problem with this hype is that the complexities are not presented well enough or even at all, so it typically sounds like you only need to learn coding (Python/R), a little bit of statistics, and then machine learning. So you get excited and learn these, then realise that with only these skills, you are just about the most useless DS professional in the competitive talent pool. You even find that your counterparts have additional tools in their stack (e.g., badass SQL, Spark, Kafka, Storm, SageMaker, etc). Now, you have a new motivation, so you throw in more tools to your learning curve.. But all the while you have not learned or developed skills in the deep, intricate principles for driving business value with data science. You have not learned how to extend the capabilities of a data engineer and analyst to get additional business value that those areas alone cannot provide.

2829,5/15/22,12:06 AM, +234 904 894 6475, You nailed it! The ability to drive business value is what keeps one in demand. I was about to extend my earlier post by adding how data scientists can create business value using data science.,15/05/2022 00:06,Sunday,194,36,12,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!
2830,5/15/22,12:18 AM, +234 904 894 6475," For example, in data science, the problems we solve typically revolve around causal inference, machine learning or decision optimisation. Some jobs might focus on only 1 or 2 of these areas. Now, applying any of these 3 scientific pillars to business problems presents us with 2 layers of difficulty.. One layer is the scientific layer, where the difficulties are mostly around reasoning and problem solving. Reasoning, because the problems (after being formalised in a data science framework) are not always open-ended and you have to draw out the connections and literally create the trajectory for how your solution should evolve. Reasoning requires abstract thought and the ability to deduce things from first principles, and this is one of the most important skills for data science yet the most untapped. Problem solving is another difficulty because you have to be adaptive enough to different solution approaches until you find the most suitable. Also requires you to be persistent enough to push through roadblocks, and alert and objective enough to spot limitations in your methodology and skillfully eliminate them.. Now, the second layer is the business layer, where the difficulty lies with aligning science to business. Science is mostly deterministic, business is mostly stochastic. Applying data science to business then means developing or implementing the specific principles of science that allow us to deal with the ""stochastic"" nature of a business landscape that is constantly ""changing"" with new ""data"". This is why data science is built on solid foundations of calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Notice the 3 things in quotes",15/05/2022 00:18,Sunday,1658,260,12,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

2834,5/15/22,1:24 AM, +234 813 774 1580," Well said, the discussion is always deeper than it seems. In addition to that, its just like back in the days when it was believed that computers will take away bankers jobs but its only going to enhance their effectiveness and evolution. DS and AI can easily be misunderstand in similar fashion.. If one wants to switch career, feel free to do that but don't do it because it is perceived that one is going into extinction. Till this day, the confusion is still there on who a DS is. As the world evolve, DS has grown into a role that requires some part of DE,  ML, and DA; its never just about building models or doing research because if it is then, most of that can be automated. DS will forever revolve around the business impact. While a senior DS may dish out data cleaning to a Junior DS, sometimes I will say that for a new domain where you must learn and understand the business, its better you do that yourself to help you understand the data more because that's where your creativity and curiosity begins and it will aid your discussion with stakeholders.. Amazon  had a lot of open roles in the US for DS in 2022 alone.. Personally, I'm a crush of both DE, ML, and Data Product Manager. Remember, every data person out there is a product manager. This is not because I think DS is going into extinction but because that's where I love to be for now. @2347038065681 may host a show for us to discuss this😁.

4481,5/20/22,1:08 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi," @2347038455619. Just as @2348180472075 mentioned Khimball approach majorly leveraged the ETL paradigm prior the Cloud DW where storage and computing resources was a limitation.. Many approach proposed by Khimball still form the fundamental for any Dimensional Modeling, however there is more allowance for stuff as against the strict rules defined by Khimball. Interestingly many still hold on to Khimball, Data Vault and Immnon for that approach.. So the fundamental of Khimball star schema, fact and dimensions still applies only that now we now have options of leveraging OBT (One big Table). The approach to Dimension modeling is now opinionated which is very challenging because you have to decide if you want to adopt Khimball or OBT or an Hybrid and also determine when using Khimball will be much better.. Interestingly there folks that still adhere to Khimball 100%. I recently designed a model for a client discarding Khimball because I felt for that use case it won’t be optimal for downstream users. The client didn’t accept that they want to adhere strictly to Khimball. So lot of decision need to be made as it relate to approach and trade-off.",20/05/2022 13:08,Friday,1159,190,1,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

But typically, a data product manager will be in charge of data team leads, especially if the role is generic. What I mean is that some data product managers are tasked with very generic responsibilities, like handling the entire suite of data products. So imagine if the person is to coordinate everything from metrics to dashboards to machine learning to experimentation. Then you can be sure he or she will be supervising several team leads.. However, some data product manager roles can be very specific. E.g., some just require you to focus on ML platform and strategy. In that case, such a person may be directly leading a team.. Finally, I think there's a difference between a data product owner and data product manager. A data product owner may just own or build out something very specific and be in charge of that. More like the ""individual contributor"" role that is more common with senior software engineer positions. On the other hand, the data product manager will seat at the intersection of business strategy and technical operations.

The how will vary from organisation to organisation based on maturity. For me, it was starting with BI because BI wasn't yet at a mature stage and I chose a use case that was visible to execs but also not to complex to execute. However, if I was leading the data team in a bank or telco, that probably won't fly, a DS use case would have been more ideal or even a DE use case where we simplify infrastructure and speed up time to insights..

5084,5/22/22,7:16 PM, +234 818 047 2075," One other thing that is critical is having a data strategy. The reason it is super important is that data teams can easily become more reactive than proactive. By reactive, I mean working on ad-hoc requests that have minimal impact. The strategy helps you ensure you are focused on the strategic use cases and not ad-hoc requests. Typically ad-hoc requests shouldn't take more than 30% of your teams time. Without a strategy, it will most likely take 90% especially because they will sound legitimate, important and urgent even though they add little value",22/05/2022 19:16,Sunday,557,94,7,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

5109,5/22/22,10:18 PM, +234 706 936 1298," I read Kolapo’s submission, 💯 spot on, my take and approach is quite similar.. There is usually a business strategy that spells out the must win battles for most/all businesses usually done with an OKR or Strategy Map/Scorecard, as a CDO, it’s best to obtain the business strategy in conjunction with some environment scanning and prepare a data/analytics strategic response to the business strategy. This response is in form of objectives or short-medium-long term plans of the data team that aligns with the business strategy, this may come with a couple of adjustment from the stakeholder.. This gives a CDO an idea of what his/her team should look like in the next 12 months.. From my experience, starting out a new team is usually BI focused especially in corporate/enterprise, might not be same for Startups, this is because there’s an urgent need to deliver tangible/impactful elementary results which a BI team can handle end-to-end. You begin to pitch the need to scale out the team and infrastructure after delivering some tangible results (which I think is similar to Kolapo’s stand on building credibility), this is where you bring in a DE/DS because there’s a need for speed and reduce time to insight.. Prioritisation is the answer to ad-hoc requests, if not well managed, it can become a monster that keeps comings, you study the volume and frequency in a short period, the result will tell if you actually need to also scale up the BI resource in addition to scaling out to DE/DS even though you create time allowance in your initial strategy to give room for handling ad-hoc requests (you have to help save cost)",22/05/2022 22:18,Sunday,1630,277,10,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

5142,5/23/22,2:19 PM, +234 904 894 6475," Very solid thoughts from @2348180472075, @2347069361298, @2347038455619. To add to the interesting discussion, I like to look at the data value stream as a coin with three sides — Infrastructure/DE as one face, BI/DA as the other face, while Data Science (ML, research, experimentation, etc) as the edge.. The infrastructure side is usually more of a long-term, indirect, value-generator for the business. BI/DA is typically the shortest-term value-generator. DS, being the edge, is the highest value-generating side and has the greatest potential for keeping a business ahead in light of competition and market share. We all know not every org needs to have (or can even have) all 3 in place immediately. Some start with BI, others with DE. DS typically comes in at varying levels of data maturity depending on the industry. For example, most large orgs typically focus first on BI just as @2347069361298 pointed out. Non-tech startups also focus primarily on BI, while for tech-heavy startups, the focus is mostly on data infrastructure and then DA/DS.. When setting up a data team, knowing exactly which side(s) to focus on will depend on the org's maturity level and its short-medium-long term goals. This is where a data strategy comes in, to address the org's needs from where it currently is, and also give direction to it's growth trajectory in light of data value generation. For me, a data strategy should be a precursor to setting up a data team. Without data strategy, a data team could be headed for trajedy.. Preparing a data strategy that translates business strategy into tactical technology execution and resultant business outcomes is one of the first things a CDO or Head of Data needs to do, except there's already a data strategy in place. In fact, sometimes, a data strategy changes business strategy and forces the business to adopt new initiatives that can give it the advantage in the market (e.g., what Netflix did by blending a defensive and offensive data strategy). This kind of data strategy optimises the business strategy until it reaches doninance.. For a Head of Data, I think the biggest challenge is in getting buy-in from senior leadership, especially in large orgs. As @2348180472075 pointed out, getting visibility and credibility early is very important. Senior leadership don't care about technology until it communicates value. The challenge is in making data strategy expressive enough that it transcends beyond the technology and workflows to growth opportunities that can meet or exceed business expectations. Technology is tactical, execs will only see strategy when the tech is connected to business outcomes. This is the only way to create trust, and without trust it's hard to get buy-in from senior leadership to support potentially valuable data initiatives.. This leads me back to the data value stream as a coin with 3 sides. As a way to build trust with execs, one key thing a data strategy must be able to communicate is near-term value generation. This is where BI comes in most times. Execs are able to quickly see and quantify business impact. Once trust can quickly be established, the data strategy can then go on to present the value proposition in the other 2 sides. Based on such a strategy, if I'm to build out a data team for a large org at a low data maturity level, the first 6 to 12 months would look something like 60-70% BI/DA, 20% AE/DE and 10-20% DS. Ad-hoc requests can be prioritised under the BI slot.. Once there's a track record of success, and credibility is established, senior leadership then knows they can trust you with value generation with DS and DE that can be more long-term. At this point, the focus can then shift significantly from BI. For tech-focused startups my approach will be different, my prioritisation will be heavier on DS and DE. This is because tech startups are generally already sold in on the huge potential of these 2 sides, not to mention those that focus heavily on data products.",23/05/2022 14:19,Monday,3989,669,2,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

5490,5/24/22,10:04 PM, +234 706 057 7846," MY THOUGHT. If you are in an enterprise business, you will understand that the value that Microsoft Suite offers is difficult to be outcompeted by any other BI tools in the industry for some years.. For example, subscription for Zoom per user per month will get you the minimum Microsoft 365 Packages for a year which comes with over 15 Apps and Services. The same thing goes for ClickUp and many other Apps and services out there.. These Apps and Services (Microsoft's) when combined together can solve $100k+ business problem in many scenarios. This is why the enterprise value will continue to be a great advantage.. Coming down to BI Tools, the ability to use Power BI for Free within SharePoint List, within MS Teams for Teams Activity Analytics, and several other embedding capabilities within the ecosystem will earn then the top tier always.. When a growing Startups get to a point where they started getting matured in Processes around Risk, Compliance, and Audit (on Data, Processes, and Regulatory domains), they will most likely adopt Microsoft Services to easily navigate that scenario but I stand to be corrected.. Microsoft One Oasis playbook is the Ecosystem. They will continue to leverage on this to become leader in many technology areas in the coming years.",24/05/2022 22:04,Tuesday,1278,214,10,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

As a party chieftain, you're amongst a privileged few that will decide the fate of millions of Nigerians by your choice of party candidate - which can spell either good or evil for all of us👿 (An example is Buhari). You'll also be influential in deciding who gets what when it comes to govt appointments and positions. To a reasonable extent, you'll also enjoy unhindered access to the seat of power (don't even know if this can be seen as a flex of sort). Even though all of these might come at the detriment of the country's progress. So do we come together to demand an overhaul of the party delegate system?💀 If we must defeat these people and all the issues bedeviling our country since 1960, then we all must do the needful.

Now we want to group the people using properties like “old”, “rich”, “healthy”, and the likes. To actually know these groups, we need to first calculate the positions of the most “old”, most “rich”, and most “healthy” among the people in the space. Calculating this allows us to zero in on the number of groups we want. Afterwards, the distance between each data point and each of the centroids is calculated, and the smallest distance out of the calculated ones is attached to a centroid, and thus belongs to that “cluster”.

The truth is, just because something isn't popular doesn't mean it can't deliver or even outperform the popular ones. This is why in this data space, you have to constantly update yourself and get familiar with a vast array of tools. Otherwise you get outdated. It is true that we don't need to jump at every new tool, and even if we wanted, where's the time?

The reason is that number 2 seems to depend on factors about the employees work experience and track records. Therefore we can adopt an improve baye's theorem referred to as Causal Calculus, e.g The probability that employee should gain subsidy because they spent this x-years and the salary is below NGNy. The  EDA will tell if the approach is less costly compare to number 1. But number 1 is more of how the historically employed college graduates have succeeded and also benefits the company, thereby taking a look at predicting the churn rate and the cost of retaining them over the same period as number 2.. In summary, DS problems are not always straight forward but then, a stakeholder who has no idea is requesting for a straight forward answer. A lot about the problem statement is tied to the 'why?'.. This 'why?' comes with 'what? Where? and when?'; which I believe EDA will tell you.

7387,5/29/22,10:27 PM, +234 904 894 6475," The answer to this is that they are both causal inference problems. They are both problems that answer yes or no, either of which require evidentiary support because they are decision choices. Machine learning would not suffice to approach those questions, at least not in the way they were posed. The questions were posed as decision questions. The answer must be a single, justified, decision response.. A prediction problem will look something like ""Are college graduates better employees (by job performance or other metric)? Then we can go into historical data and use machine learning to capture the relationship between observatory variables and outcomes. Machine learning uses correlation to make predictions. But the model doesn't guarantee there's causation. The original question 1 is not asking if college graduates will be better, it's asking if the decision to hire college graduates is right. It's asking for cause and effect. The response must describe a policy that supports the relationship between the decision (not the variables) and the outcome. The model that will achieve this must infer what the cause-and-effect policy is.. For the rephrased question, machine learning will produce knowledge that asserts the likelihood of your decision quality being high, should you make the decision based on some metric. The likelihood is never a 100%. For the original questions, however, causal inference will produce knowledge that asserts definitively that your decision quality is high, whether it's a yes or no. Machine learning supports decisions, causal inference outputs decisions. To justify a causal inference assertion, the policy must prove to make better decisions than a person making decisions using the best available metrics from machine learning. That's more sophisticated than anything simple correlation can handle because the number of factors that contribute to decision quality is very high.",29/05/2022 22:27,Sunday,1928,297,10,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

7389,5/29/22,10:49 PM, +234 904 894 6475," Interesting. No 2 is rightly causal inference. But if you implement Bayesian inference in the way you described it in your example, it would not be causal inference and the results would be off. Working out the probability that an employee should get the subsidy makes it a predictive probabilistic model. It means you are looking at each employee and computing the posterior probability distribution of the outcome, conditioned on the joint distribution of the observations for that employee. That is a predictive approach.. Then, for question 1, check what I noted in my answer about the difference between the question versus when it is slightly rephrased. Question 1 is causal inference because it's a question of whether or not to make the decision. The response is a yes or a no that must be justified as the right decision. Machine learning doesn't justify decisions, it gives a certain likelihood that a decision quality will be high if the decision is taken based on some metric.

7391,5/29/22,11:14 PM, +234 813 774 1580," Thanks for your input, but I disagree with you because conditional probability is different from causal calculus. The theory is the same but the mathematical application is different because causal calculus is based on actual occurrence of the event, e.g P(x | do{y}) - probability of x given that y is done or carried out successfully; is different from P(x | y) - probability of x given y(irrespective of the condition).. This I have applied on a real life project of recent.. For your follow up, read my sentence above. I said, 'if I'm to give you an answer because you want one' meaning I don't allow stakeholders to rush me. My approach is simple, think of fundamental ways the problem can be solved. Bucket those approach and isolate them then, analyse the available data, and combine the findings before suggesting the best way to the stakeholders. By so doing, you save yourself and the project including the stakeholder. Well I agree that they are both causal inference but try to understand the last part of the question.. #If_ rush_DS_e_go_rush_you",29/05/2022 23:14,Sunday,1060,181,11,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

7393,5/30/22,12:53 AM, +234 904 894 6475," @2348137741580, Again, interesting thoughts. Note that my goal in discussions like this is not to stimulate argument but to foster conversations that lead to better understanding of the nuances of subject matter.. I like your emphasis on causal calculus; it's a powerful tool that extends Bayes theory to model the effect of interventions. However, you cannot say conditional probability is different from causal calculus. This is because causal calculus is built on it. The application is also not different; in fact causal calculus applies conditional probabilities.. Secondly, the way you have described P(x | do{y}) makes it, in fact, the same as P(x | y) because the latter updates the degree of belief in x as information about the occurrence of y arises. For example, during inference in probabilistic modelling, we feed in data of actual occurrences to a trained Bayesian belief network or other suitable probabilistic graphical model, and the network returns the probability of the outcome based on those inputs that have actually already occurred.. What you missed is that the difference between P(x | do{y}) and P(x | y) lies in applying external intervention to hold y constant in P(x | do{y}). In P(x | y), the y event can change and each time changes occur, our degree of belief in x gets updated. In P(x | do{y}), we set an intervention to force y not to change and want to see the combined effects of this intervention and the observations on x.. With that being said, causal calculus cannot be applied for the questions in the way you have described it, given the way I specified the questions. Understand that the questions are not asking for inference based on relationship between observations and outcomes from historical data. They are asking for the relationship between a yes-or-no decision and the outcome of that decision. So in this case, it is not P(good performance after subsidising education | years spent & salary upper bound) more like what you earlier specified. It would actually be P(good decision | do{decision}).. On a last note, I agree with you that projects need not be rushed. A data scientist must carefully decompose the problem so well to understand what simple steps to take first before adding complexity if needed. However, I specified the 2 questions the way I did to present a data science use case that even many data scientists are not familiar with. My goal was specifically to stimulate reasoning about how to approach those problems from a decision science perspective. It doesn't mean they cannot be tackled in other, simpler ways. Also, machine learning can solve the 2 problems when you slightly rephrase them to shift from the decision maker to the data treatments the decision is to be made upon.. For us that come from the mathematics field, it's a lot easy to catch these nuances because of years of reasoning grounded in rigour. Communicating it to a broad audience is a skill only a fraction of us have.",30/05/2022 00:53,Monday,2968,502,12,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

Here knowledge from data science, behavioural science and decision science are needed to fully specify the complex relationship between the decision and the outcome.. Because as it turns out, there's a complex behavioural dynamics that influences performance on the job. A company has to know whether having educated employees will optimise this behavioural dynamics and ultimately improve job performance. If job performance improves, the decision is high quality. Else, the decision is low quality. With causal inference, we can test several combinations of behavioural dynamics until we fully understand what exact combination is required to maximise the desired outcome.

For example, you opt for the second option not because you know for sure you will get ₦1bn in one trial, but because you know the probability of getting it and you know the expected utility.. The goal is not to make money every time, but to take the risks that will bring about the highest cumulative gains when such offers come over and over again.. It will take this trial being repeated 1000 times to get to ₦1bn if we always choose option 1. But for option 2, even if we get ₦1bn twice in 1000 trials (which is almost impossible), you already have twice as much.",05/06/2022 16:35,Sunday,767,145,4,2022,5,6,May

So I would suggest this line of approach below.. Firstly ehn, this is not happening for the first time and since according to them, these 2 or 3 rows affects figures greatly. I would want to say it is some kind of accounting scenario as trust me if the top Stakeholders gets displeased easily with this (which seems more like a toxic workplace to me already)  then, they should have done the following.. 0. Understand why the business is so irritated and angered by this.. 1. On the second occurrence, they should have escalated seriously in such a way that they would let the Business Top Guns know the consequences of having to handle this from the internal team's end and raised SLA concerns because this is third party data. SLA and compliance are very important when dealing with third party data. It is good as Engrs to know what level of accuracy to expect when dealing with external systems so as to put this into design consideration. Read the docs and understand the SLAs of this external tools and systems first.. 2. Dedicate time to investigate and perform analysis to prove it is really that a few missing records that causes a discrepancy. They are non-technical people and they won't try to understand the issue unless you *STORY-TELL IT*. Also come up with recommendation and highlight you really need the vendor's assistance.. 3. And Since the third Party Guys kept giving the same response, they should have revisited their current Data Env Design and let let the business know the extra cost to put checks on validating extra data because this would mean special implementations on logs and monitoring of Source data.(Though this would give room for even some redundant implementations just to make sure data is valid). 3. Propose new solution and cost analysis to the business on what accommodating this discrepancy from the internal team end would look like.. 4.

But I feel there are lots of behind-the-scenes we are not seeing here, considering that the project is being executed for a client. Perhaps the issue is not that the missing data has a direct negative impact on the project. It could be that the SLA with the client has a clause that specifies a 100% data integrity requirement, a breach of which would incur a certain cost to the business.. It becomes a problem when the engineers are not aware of this clause or don't even have access to the SLA. It's easier to build precautions aforehand when you already know the impact of the slightest failures.",06/06/2022 23:25,Monday,751,137,11,2022,6,6,Jun

Working with the MDS truly will be chaotic as more tools unfold creating an overhead and bottlenecks as it relate to managing.. The number of vendors I have tested their products that integrate with MDS in the last 6 months really proves there will be lot of chaos and difficulty to decide the tool stack to setup and how to properly manage which will increase billing..

It's a subscription business. 2. A subscription by a customer lasts for 4 months. For example, if I subscribe with 10k in January 2023, it will expire in April 2023. And if I don't subscribe again in May 2023, then I would have been considered churned.. 3. Number 2 above implies that a customer can have only max 3 subscriptions per year..

9761,06/08/2022,10:36 AM, +234 703 845 5619," Okay this is the interesting part😄. If 1 subscribe this month, the source system only captures the date of payment i.e January and ignores the other months in the cycle.. and if another payment is made after the cycle, the system only captures the date of payment.. In other words, the source system does not capture the cycle.. Another case in the source system is how it handles Annual payments.. If I pay in January for a whole year, this equals 3 cycles of Jan to April, May to August, Sept to Dec and the source system only captures the dates JAN, MAY and SEPT with the same subscription_id for the period; i.e 3 records with the same subscription_id and dates that only match the start of the subscription.. I however created surrogate key for subscription_id as I believe that each subscription whether annual or one time payments should be unique.. 2. Based on your analogy, if you subscribe in January only one record is created for your with date in January. If your next sub is in Nov, the system only captures one record for that with date in Nov.. Please ask more for further clarification boss",08/06/2022 10:36,Wednesday,1108,199,10,2022,8,6,Aug

9767,06/08/2022,11:06 AM, Opeyemi Fabiyi," Spot on. Since the id is tied uniquely to just 1 customer. You will factor annual subscription into your modeling.. Annual/quarterly doesn’t really matter per se in this instance since your goal is to capture activeness and inactivity, so you already know if a customer has an annual subscription that mean the  customer will be active next 12 Month ahead.. However, your modeling approach may now change if you want your downstream user to have a filter that indicate subscription type in case they are interested in knowing with subscription type have the impact on MRR. This is also possible but will create little complication in modeling. Since they haven’t asked you just assume they don’t need it yet 😂😂 when they do you will update the existing model you built without considering that.",08/06/2022 11:06,Wednesday,795,136,11,2022,8,6,Aug

Your first task is to remodel this date to look like this ;. subscription_id | customer_id | start_date which is the payment _date | end date which will be dependent on the subscription type | amount. E.g. If subscription type is annual and payment_date (start date) is 2022-06-08 then end date = 2023-06-08.

9805,06/08/2022,12:23 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi," Next approach after transforming the source data to reflect the above.. Create a Date spine model to reflect one record per customer per product per month. To create this.. Create a utility date dimension for each months from your db start date to current date (use dbt_utils.datespine). Then use that date dimension to create the the monthly/product/customer subscription data. However, it’s a bit tricky with your use case so you will need to factor in month in-between when there was no activity/subscription for a particular customer/product. To help you can create an helper column to identify status change (more like active, church, reactivation ) using the scenario I painted for myself (Jan - April, I’m active, May - September *churn* and October - I reacted my plan for that particular product since your own case have a dynamic of multiple instances)",08/06/2022 12:23,Wednesday,863,142,12,2022,8,6,Aug

What I will say helped me is basically reading a lot of articles, blogs and conversations of folks to understand how they think and approach a task and subtly I start seeing myself see things differently , so it rub off. I believe that’s the best way rather than going to go and look for one soft skills course.. Till date I try to read atleast 3 articles or read conversations on random stuffs on slack every day. It just help me see how others think and approach a task, so next time I see a similar task I already have an idea of how to tackle it.",09/06/2022 09:40,Thursday,667,131,9,2022,9,6,Sep

9973,06/09/2022,10:59 AM, +234 706 632 1212, Hello. I’m working on a task to compare two versions of a developed data dashboard. The earlier version is live and the latest is still on staging (to be pushed to production soon). I am in search of an efficient approach to identify data discrepancies between the two versions in order to resolve it.. The aim of this task is to have all the data in the previous version reflecting on the latest one. I am open to ideas. Thanks 🙏🏼,09/06/2022 10:59,Thursday,432,82,10,2022,9,6,Sep

You just have to find a way to memorise the theorems and pour them back to the lecturer.. Most of the theorems didn't make sense because the lecturer couldn't explain as well.. Numerical methods sitting in a league of its own. 🥵. Online courses came to the rescue after school though. But I wish something can be done about how our teachers teach. Because the courses they taught us were relevant but mostly theoretical and lacked depth. They also discourage new ideas and methods that are not present in the books they copy from.. I remember that they usually hide the text book they teach from. This reminds me of Operations research and Experimentation.,14/06/2022 08:01,Tuesday,777,134,8,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

10605,6/14/22,7:19 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi, Create a ticket approach.. Discuss with all stakeholders to drop there adhoc requests before a certain time 2pm as an example and let them know when it will be ready.. Inform them any request that doesn’t come in before your set time will be deprioritized till the next day.. You can then allocate some few hours within the day to address the requests. And you can also have a day set aside for infrastructure work and let them know that day you aren’t attending to any request,14/06/2022 19:19,Tuesday,478,88,7,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

11789,6/20/22,3:08 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi," 2 approach. 1. Easiest option - remove that data.  My assumption is since it’s a global data the proportion should be infinitesimal given that it’s only specific to Canada, so not sure there’s any interesting insight you want to communicate.

Get data over a period and  track if spend of certain customers is dropping. For customers who their value is dropping, I will check if they have given any negative feedback on our services or if there has been some downtime that has impacted them. Based on all that I can take specific actions.. 2. Check onboarding data for my clients. Check company size or use a proxy. Then compute an estimated expected spend for the customers and compare to what they are currently spending. Where the gap is high, we can get any additional info of how to increase the spend of those clients.",23/06/2022 12:40,Thursday,717,133,12,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

Now the trigger for the code to run is when a new entry enters the Google Sheet. The entry comes from a form online. So when a person fills the form, the Google Sheet is updated with a new entry (or row) and I want that activity to trigger the Python code to automatically run using that new data.. I have the Python code that does this offline. But of course, I have to manually run the code and be awake always to monitor the Google Spreadsheet which is impossible. I'd want the entire process to be run in real-time now without any human intervention.. I'd appreciate advice from anyone. Would be nice if you have done something similar.",24/06/2022 10:04,Friday,1087,205,10,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

13739,07/01/2022,2:00 PM, +234 904 894 6475, The reason why the pizza is not treated as a cylinder here is because we can consider the cylinder height as a constant for both pizzas. So we can neglect that height and simply work with the cross-section which is a circle.,01/07/2022 14:00,Friday,225,43,2,2022,1,7,Jan
13740,07/01/2022,2:02 PM, +234 904 894 6475," I respectfully disagree. If you want to think about it conceptually, try to place two pizzas with 5 inch radius side by side into the cross-section of a single pizza with 10 inch radius. The two pizzas will fit in exactly across the diameter of the larger pizza, but you are going to clearly notice a lot of space between the cross-section of the 2 pizzas and that of the larger one.. What happened? The combined circumference of the 2 pizzas is equal to the circumference of the larger one, but the size is not the same. The size of each pizza is not determined by circumference which is simply the length (or perimeter) of the cross-section. The size is, in fact, determined by area.. So the OP's calculation is valid (of course, approximating the pizza's cross-section as a circle)",01/07/2022 14:02,Friday,785,141,2,2022,1,7,Jan

Using scikit-learn's predict_proba to return predicted probabilities. I had no idea it was a dangerously naive approach that only worked well for logistic regression and a few others.. It turns out that when you use it in most other classification tasks, the predicted probability distribution is only approximated and hardly conforms with the expected probability distribution. A better approach is to calibrate the probability distribution using Platt scaling (or for large datasets, isotonic regression). More recently, I discovered another powerful approach with conformal predictions. I'm surprised how these techniques are hardly covered in courses and even the top books in the field.. For machine learning in particular, a really good understanding of the underlying statistical or probabilistic aspects of one's workflow is invaluable. Otherwise, one may not understand why there's a certain results or know what other things can be done to improve them.. Another thing that's very useful in data is communication and collaboration.

I think people need to continue preaching how MDS has improved their data intelligence process and less of following prevalent media but then prevalent media will still prevail in decision making.😅. I personally do not think Post MDS will fly, even if it does it won't be as it is preached. But then if it does, Post MDS will still be like MDS because more products will still be created along these lines.. And with the abundance of tools in MDS, more and more consulting experts like Data Cult and Co will be contracted for needs assessment and recommendation as what tools fit a particular business.. I also saw the Airbyte critic, Critics are good as it helps them improve on their products but then it paint's an image of a completely bad tool... but then no tool is entirely bad.",06/07/2022 11:44,Wednesday,929,168,11,2022,6,7,Jun

I like the submission of *Chad Sanderson* which truly explain a major challenge with MDS which is possibility of Data swamp if modeling not taking seriously and the JOIN Problem.. She really murdered Airbyte in that post which isn’t completely true 😅😅. I’m sure you use Airbyte and I built the stack previously on Airbyte. Definitely like you mentioned there’s always room for improvement but doesn’t mean the tool is terrible like Lauren posed..

The MDS may not be the final promised land but it is better than where we are coming from. The chaos in the data space is a good thing because it points to gaps which still need to be improved upon even in the MDS. At the end of the day the data team must deliver value if the team wants to keep their jobs. So whether MDS o or LDS, or LSA just deliver value.

They don't even know the tool stack. I am now having to think through how to track value either from a revenue generation or cost reduction/efficiency perspective. At the end of the day this is what matters. MDS helps to speed up the time to value and in some cases increases value cause it makes some things easier. But you must deliver that value to be relevant one way or the other.,06/07/2022 14:40,Wednesday,513,98,2,2022,6,7,Jun

14753,07/06/2022,3:30 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi, 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿. Time to value generation and initially increased value is actually the strength of what MDS pitch its tenth on. You can literally spin up a whole Data infrastructure that generate value in little time and minimal technical resource.. No doubt technical debts may pile up in future if not done well but the temporal quick wins and value matter to Senior execs in the interim.  Just as @2349048946475  pointed out that most times the value-drivers may not necessary be highly optimized which I believe will be an ongoing process.. The koko as you mentioned boss @2348180472075 is VALUE!!!. I guess it’s more job for Consulting firms like ours to help clients determine the best stack to opt-in for per time whether MDS/LDS or hybrid.. @2347038065681 you asked this question one time about what will be the fact of Data Consulting focused company if all company build in-house competence?

Laurel sha told her no and all. In all honesty I saw the conversation because she posted it on LinkedIn though deleted now, I didn’t see any iota of her been abusive or condescending.

Some of the losses will be human related and not tool related. What we need to do is to find out if many companies are having more losses than wins, if they are then MDS is probably broken (dead is such a strong word which only applies if no company is getting value).",08/07/2022 13:18,Friday,419,86,1,2022,8,7,Aug

Then maybe after doing few Kaggles now start learning how to put code into production beyond Jupiter notebooks.. Maybe pick 1 end to end project from Data extraction down to deployment to do.  That’s why true true I believe DS/ML isn’t for beginners unless you want to give it 2years of learning atleast,08/07/2022 17:24,Friday,383,72,5,2022,8,7,Aug

Master a viz tool, master SQL, master either Python or R, or both. Maybe add some automation skill. With these you can function in any hands-on area in data. There are so many aspects of these skills that are highly transferrable. So, even when all sorts of ""stack"" come up now and then, and the need arises for you to work with new tools, you will find it relatively fast to learn. Many companies even know that having strengths in the above core skills is proof that you can easily transition to new tools.. The long and short is that many skills are ephemeral, but few skills can serve you for the long-term. Focus on the latter.",08/07/2022 22:01,Friday,761,141,10,2022,8,7,Aug

15764,07/12/2022,2:47 PM, Joe," What I think might work (I run it in my head and it works, it might fail when you use a normal interpreter).. I'm assuming you can use python.. I would use python string split method. At first, I thought about splitting by hyphen then I saw that some words can have hypen. Then I realized that I don't think there's any English word (I stand to be corrected) that space will follow the hyphen back and front.. So I think if you should split with ' - ' (space hyphen space). You should have a list. [ Question, SAP name , Answer]. Thinking out loud 😁",12/07/2022 14:47,Tuesday,550,108,2,2022,12,7,Dec

Sure we can advocate and drop information to nudge everyone to get their PVCs to exercise their franchise and whoever you choose to vote for or why we think a candidate is the savior Nigeria is expecting should be avoided.. No doubt it’s a Data centric group and also doesn’t mean we can’t have conversations outside of Data, however such conversations should be one that won’t trigger unnecessary uproar like religion, ethnicity or politics..

Career - start from year one. Forget the company, list what tasks you did and what was accomplished in each one.. b. Projects. Use the STAR method.. c. Extracurricular eg. firm contributions. How did you use your interests and skills to help others grow.. 2. Take every item in (1) and slot them under job headings.. For example, I've done work in Audit, accounting, forensic, risk management. And data projects. So I created headings for each one.. 3. Do a search on job titles you're interested in and what skills and tasks are required.. a. Map your discovery to your own experiences.. b. Where are you lagging? Plan to close the gap.. 4. Transfer this to your CV.. a. Summary (may or may not be necessary depending on the years of experience you have).. b. Skills (technical and soft skills related to the role.. c. Experience. d. Portfolio/Projects (include links to git/medium/wherever you documented). e. Education. f. Certifications and trainings. g. Achievement. 5. Items in (4) above can be rearranged to stress what's most relevant to the recruiter.. You want to put the most important thing at the top. People don't always have time to read the world on your resume lol.. If you're going to put a summary section (not objective), make sure you stress leadership ability (if it's a managerial or lead role) and the core areas of your expertise.. There are no hard and fast rules to these things tbh, but cv revamps are an ongoing thing in your career.. Keep a working documents on G-doc to take note of accomplishments and tasks so you don't forget.. ✌🏽",13/07/2022 11:15,Wednesday,1718,300,11,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

Maybe you're comparing their low/no code solutions to open-source coding solutions that's why you think they're easy.. For example, their story maps looks easy because it's a no code solution. The open-source alternative is to use leafletjs and maybe GeoDjango to build a webmap. So ESRI's solution is easier in this case because it's no code.. However, compare arcgis to qgis. The ease of use in QGIS is too much for arcgis.. The only good side I know about ESRI products is interoperability. The seamlessness of Arcgis desktop with arcgis online/enterprise and their mobile apps (survey123 and arcgis fieldmaps) is impressive..

Had to repair installation at one point. 2) how would you approach parsing a nested JSON with dynamic keys (some of keys has numbers that changes at the end of the string). I have a list of all the variations. What I'm thinking. join the keys with a delimiter to become a single string then use regex to find the full string for each key..

17270,7/19/22,10:48 AM, +234 803 353 6901," *NNPC Quietly Approves Petrol Pump Price Hike To ₦179/Litre*. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has approved an upward review in the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) from N165 per litre to N179 per litre, effective today (Tuesday).. NNPC in a notice to fuel marketers directed them to change the petrol price on pumps to the new price effective today. This was even as the company equally increased the ex-depot price from N148.17 to N167 per litre.. This came after weeks of petrol scarcity resurfaced across the country as fuel retailers were adopting different price bands to force unofficial deregulation attempts.. Already, majority of filling stations in Lagos have adopted different price models. While some filling stations have changed the price on their meters to reflect the current price they are selling at, others have left theirs to show the approved retail price of N165 per litre but were selling above the displayed price.. For instance, the Mobil filling station on Agidingbi sold a litre of petrol at N170 per litre on Friday and that was evidently displayed on their meters.. The development was also the same at Enyo filling station at Chisco bus stop, in Lekki, which now sells for N170 per litre, Eterna filling station at Jankade bus stop, Lekki sells at N180 per litre and Mobil Filing station, by Osapa London, Lekki now selling at N170 per litre.",19/07/2022 10:48,Tuesday,1404,235,10,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

But this zero interest and access to 50% of your salary, from mid- month ,  It's a way to generate massive traffic.. But as time goes on, Interest would surely be added, at a very minimal rate, such that would won't see it as harmful. I doubt if in this our Nigeria of today, a business can be sustained, long-term on transactions fee or perhaps they have other revenue streams which compliments this business to make funds accessible and available for all requesting for up to 50% of their salaries before 30 days due date, at once....

18345,7/25/22,3:35 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi," @2348180472075. Semantic layers is a fraction of Metric layer.. The basic idea of Metric is to solve one major challenge with most BI tool that tracks metrics.. Let’s use Power BI where your semantic layer will be where your build your Data model , define all entities and relationships as well as the DAX measures that will be leveraged for reporting.. The current approach create a bottleneck where any new metrics created with DAX is locked-in in Power BI and can’t be accessible outside Power BI.. As an example, let’s say there is a measure that calculate customers with the highest purchase where there is a measure to do that.. What if Product or Marketing folks need to setup a pipeline that reference that data for further downstream workflow like email marketing or any form of product analytics ? There is a bottleneck to access that at the moment because that metric is locked-in. A Data Scientist can’t access that metric for optimization, they will have to recreate the metric (this create what is called Siloed metrics across). So self service isn’t then self service as proposed which now lead to a new trend called *Headless BI* built on Metrics layer.. What then is this new paradigm?. There is a single source of truth for all metrics that can be accessed across tools and not locked in by any tool. So see it as Decoupling Power BI where the Data modeling and DAX is separated.. Data thought leaders believe this new paradigm will solve a lot of issues.. I hope that help provide more context.",25/07/2022 15:35,Monday,1514,266,3,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!

18381,7/25/22,5:19 PM, Opeyemi Fabiyi," There is currently lot of arguments on the best approach to the metrics layer.. Most are tilting towards SQL since the layer will be consumed by Data Analyst as well as other less tech savvy folks.. Another opinion is pushing for configuration templated YAML approach that will have an API extraction that can be exposed to any tool.. So lot of conversations building up. There are tools already playing in that space though ; Transform, Trace, Gooddata etc.. There is also any option of leverage dbt as the metrics layer. dbt has a feature in the beta stage called *metrics* (I haven’t used it but I’m read the issue in the codebase).

He published about 3 major papers that led up to the solution of the Poincare conjecture. It took around 3 or 4 years of expert review for his solution to be certified as correct and complete.. But in that period of time, there were other prominent mathematicians (especially from US), who had been racing towards the solution, who tried to discredit him and rubbish his work. Perelman was not a very social mathematician in terms of relating well with other mathematicians, and so most of them treated him like he didn't belong. You know that kind of cult behaviour where people feel someone who isn't in their clique cannot and should not have a seat on the table. It was this kind of behaviour that was the last straw for Perelman.. Imagine trying to run away from so many issues of society and finally you think mathematics is the place where you can hide from all those problems, only to be eventually treated the same way by mathematicians you consider family 🥲.

We have that disconnect over here.. Our mathematicians don't tend to have world class mentors. Maybe just very few exceptions, but these ones don't go ahead to further push the boundaries.. Our mathematicians don't get to study in some of the greatest places to get nurtured in rigorous mathematics and meet really great mathematicians, e.g, Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Stanford, etc. If you check most of the Nigerians that make it into prestigious universities, you will find that it's literally all other areas except mathematics. So our mathematicians hardly make it into places where the greatness gets handed down. Kings are raised through kings.
