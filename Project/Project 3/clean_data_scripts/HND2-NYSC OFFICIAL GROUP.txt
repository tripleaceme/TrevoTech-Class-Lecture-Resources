6/17/21, 7:37 PM - Adegbite Abel: For those that were disrespectful to my First Lady @2348132027307 today, I’ve met with some stakeholders in the cabinet and they’ve pleaded on their behalf and promised that those fellows will from henceforth accord the respect due to my First Lady @2348132027307 and also my president himself @2349033024846 ..


Their studentship status shall be reviewed and restored 


Let this sound as a not of warning to every other person especially @2347063360086 @2349031335109 @2347030113738 @2348181727547 @2349057140280 @2347068933394 that disrespect of any form will not be tolerated.

On the final note, this is a special warning to @2348082871551 that you should teach your wife @2348181727547 and son @2347063360086 to be respectful in the society. 

Don’t let me teach them what you’ve failed to teach them at home.

Thank you

Now that your studentship status has been reviewed and restored, two of you @2348118858990 and @2348036285935 are hoodlums trying to cause havoc and tarnish the image of this new administration. I assure you that we will not tolerate that.

Let this sound as a note of warning to every other person especially @2347063360086 @2349031335109 @2347030113738 @2348181727547 @2349057140280 @2347068933394 that disrespect of any form will not be tolerated.

On the final note, this is a special warning to @2348082871551 that you should teach your wife @2348181727547 and son @2347063360086 to be respectful in the society. 

Oga @2348082871551, you’ve not yielded to the warnings of yesterday so I’m telling you again. Hold that upcoming hoodlums of a thing you call your son @2347063360086.

Don’t let me teach them what you’ve failed to teach them at home.

Thank you

We signed lot of forms to ensure your exam holds yet you keep abusing or been disobedient. As from today henceforth, you all need to caution yourself.

Thanks.

6/24/21, 6:13 AM - Mr A'zeez Akanbi: True life story.
When I was in technical school,
My automobile instructor who was a jeovahwitness said he can not bribe anyone for promotion because he is sound theorically and practically. 
But My HOS will tell you Azeez give what belong to cesari to cesari.
3 years Mr finbbars was not promoted despite him getting 100% in all the promotions exams.
While Mr Adeleye keep getting his promotion and salary increase as at When due.
Then I happened to be there boy.
For Mr finbbars we work on cars together for 4 years in the workshop and for Mr Adeleye I work with for exam stuffs during jamb,Technical GCE and NABTEB.
In conclusion,
Every one in the school was promoted and send to different departments to lead while he remain workshop instructor because he said he can not bribe anybody for promotion. 
This make him cry openly and said to me Azeez what can I do.
It simple sir Oga give what belong to ceaser to ceaser and that of cesari to caseri.
He packed #150,000 then and travel down to Abuja.
To his surprise all his promotion was sitting under someone table in Abuja.
2 weeks after he had done the needful,he was promoted as a principal in another technical school .
Imagine what he has loose for 4 years.
Aboro is okay for omoluabi.

I Just want to say I'm sorry to any and every one that felt offended with my words, last night. *I'm sorry* 
I believe all that happened was based on the ground of misunderstanding and misinterpretation words, it is either I misunderstood the message that was passed or my statement was misunderstood by all.
However, I can't be the only right person among all, *and I'm not the wisest,* but that was just my own point of  view. *And I never insisted on it,* because I believe I can be wrong at times too.
*I'm in full support of appreciating our lecturers oo, it's fine*

*299,792.458 km per second*

The speed of light in a vacuum is 299,792.458 km per second – just shy of a nice round 300,000km/s figure. That is pretty nippy. The Sun is 150 million km away from Earth and light takes just eight minutes and 20 seconds to travel that far.

7/13/21, 10:15 AM - Raji Ridwan: PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT

Many of us today are fond of putting password/patterns on our phone which makes it difficult for someone to access it in the case of unfortunate situations like phone loss, sickness, accident or even death. But with this little knowledge I am going to share, perhaps we can save ourselves and the lives of others also.

STEP 1

When your phone is locked, it normally shows enter password. Under it, you will see emergency. Click on the emergency, then you will see emergency information. Click on the emergency information (2 times) You will see a pencil icon on your extreme right, click on it to edit.

STEP 2

Then enter the contacts you want to save as emergency. You can put as many contacts as possible but I advise you to save numbers of active people who know you very well (Family/friend).

Now these contacts you have saved can be called even when your phone is locked without entering your password.

NOTE:

To call a number under emergency, click on 'Emergency Call' and the numbers saved there will come up. You can call these numbers without unlocking the phone

A soul can be saved through this

FEEL FREE TO SHARE

You never know, your single share can save somebody's life... 

   Thank you

7/13/21, 9:13 PM - Raji Ridwan: You loaned your friend N4m last year and since then, he has refused to pay back, which has really deteriorated the friendship.

You beg him to just pay you N2m  and forget the rest because you are in a financial crisis. Your friend then says he can only get you N1.5m since that's all he has.

You feel like you have no option but to accept. You eventually give him your account details to send the amount directly to your bank.

You wake up the next morning, checked your account and there is N15m in it. You kept staring at the screen in disbelief but it is indeed 15m.

You grab your phone and find 53 missed calls from him and an additional 27 text messages begging you to transfer back N13,500,000 since he only meant to send N1.5m and mistakenly added an extra "0."

As a well-brought-up person, what are you supposed to do?

1. Send back N13,500,000/=?
2. Take your full N4,000,000/=?
3. Keep the entire N15,000,000/=?

Be sincere, if it were you what will you do ?

Topic: *How are You Using it?*
Text: *Luke.19.26*
*_"Yes,' the king replied, 'but to those who use well what they are given, even more will be given. But from those who are unfaithful, even what little they have will be taken away."_*

Everyone on the planet Earth is given a specific talent and gift, which are to be effectively used. It is when this talent is exercised that it will begin to birth other wonderful talent and gifts. Yes I know you want to other beautiful gift and talent, *but you need to be Faith with little one First* . You need the gift of prophesy, but let me ask you this question *Are you faithful with the gift of dream you have now?* Will you say the truth that God show you regardless of any body or circumstance? Yes I know you have been asking God for promotion and truly I Know you really need it, *but how much are you Faithful with this current position that God has place you?*  Hmmmm  Christ said something in Luke.16.10 - *_"Unless you are faithful in small matters, you won't be faithful in large ones. If you cheat even a little, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities."_* Can you see that? ```Except you use the little you are given now Rightly,  you will not be able to get a greater one.```  Maybe the reason you are still in that position is because you are not Faithful with it. So I encourage you this morning to *repent* and be *Faithful* , The Lord bless you.
Remember this  - *_"but to those who use well what they are given, even more will be given. But from those who are unfaithful, even what little they have will be taken away."(Luke.19.26)_* ```Also see Luke 16:10-12``` _May the communion of the Holy Spirit be with us all_*(Amen)*

*Prayer Point:* _Lord have mercy on me, and Clean me with the *Blood of Jesus* from all unrighteousness. Father please grant me abundant Life to be fully filled with the knowledge of Your Will so that I can be faithful in all good works and live for you in Jesus name, *Amen*_

8/3/21, 6:33 PM - AbdulRauf Taofeek: Mr Raheem sorry to say the main problem of this class is you reason because you are not always straight forward enough 

there is no point in this your statement, before people started engaging in the project you should have decided with everyone if we are to do it or not, you not making decision on that directly means that everyone should find his or her way for the project, 

so stop putting blame on anyone
8/3/21, 6:34 PM - Sulaimon Salam: Gbas gbos
8/3/21, 6:34 PM - +234 706 893 3394: ✅ Fact checks

8/3/21, 6:37 PM - +234 706 893 3394: Since we've agreed to do it then
So why doing as if we're not doing it again... Some had spend money on this project o
8/3/21, 6:37 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: I'm not holding anyone at ransome for doing or not doing the project, what I'm only saying is that she should have consider the fact that some are not in Ibadan at the moment
8/3/21, 6:38 PM - Salau Kike: @2349033024846 Plz tell baba Iya ibeji never finish her own....money never complete o
8/3/21, 6:38 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: @2347030113738 brought his project before exam I told him to wait for others, do you remember ?

Now that you all are saying submission when people don travel , whose advantage ?
8/3/21, 6:39 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: I truly understand that @2349031335109 is not in Ibadan but if her partner is not around, will they be ready for submission....


Check and Balance before criticizing
8/3/21, 6:40 PM - +234 706 893 3394: @2349031335109 Has not really done anything wrong... She should have just carry everyone along b4 calling baba... So that we can choose a date that Will be somehow convenient for majority of us here,,  cos it can't be convenient for everyone at the same point in time
8/3/21, 6:40 PM - AbdulRauf Taofeek: What I think you should address now is how to extend the date of submission
8/3/21, 6:40 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Extend ?
8/3/21, 6:40 PM - Raji Ridwan: ... before contacting baba regarding the project or mention anything related to it at all. simple as ABC

9/5/21, 4:11 AM - Oluwatayo Raheem: *Dean's project Response*

*Kindly go through it gently and digest before replying back 😥*


On Aug 3, Iyin declared submission of project which I called him for submission extension

Aug 18, I called Dean to inform him about what challenges we are facing on the project in terms of resources and he said "there is no need for submission anymore, you all complained that they do not teach you practical in class and that why I gave you all the practical to learn. *I'm not saying you should spend a Kobo on the project rather go round the institution waste (akitan) or go and meet all this photocopier own who are not using them anymore and plead for what you in need.*

All necessary material needed for the project is at your disposal just that you are not ready to learn. If I come to your class you will be shouting, going out to pick calls, excusing yourself from my class e.t.c...

Lot of lecturers have complained about your class already I keep on backing you all that your class is good but now , I can see you are not ready.

Based on the project mark, it's 40 mark but I won't write zero, I will write any mark there just to make sure it's not empty and for tomorrow sake and whatever you get in your exam will be recorded.

So sorry sir, I'm not annoyed but I can't mark the project again and none of your mate should complain of been taught theory only bcos the project is just to test your IQ"

 Some of the stuffs for your present project can be useful later for your final project , or for another person's final project *( keep am well well for yourself or another )*


You don't have to be offended ,just keep calm 


*General advice :*

_To all those that like private message ,Olorun ni mofi be yin .....let's be having cooperate conversations before you private chart any lecturer of Dean if faculty ..._

If the cooperate discussions now permit that on any issue then go on to private chart .... 

*We are the first set ,👉There are advantages in our cooperations and great disadvantage if we all choses to be over-smart than our neighbors*


```Don't do what will make your guy see you in the market and wipe you stick```

*Life can be very unpredictable it's could be that person that have a pass because of your forwardness that may be a manager to employ you tomorrow .... E he ki ama SE Dada ....*

```E work for me today no mean se he go smoooooot tomorrow 🤷🏻‍♂️```

9/5/21, 12:14 PM - Raheem Damilola: Can u fight???
9/5/21, 12:14 PM - Oye..Barnabas: I think I have to drop my own opinion, because I'm very angry with the ways things are going in our class.

Firstly, @2349033024846  you said you called Dean on 18th of August, to inform him about the the challenges we are facing on the project he gave us right? Lemme remind you, he has informed us that the will give us project to do since the beginning of the last semester, for us to get prepared, he gave us the project around May, and nobody said we are not doing the project, he do come to class and asked us about the project he gave us to know if we are facing problem, only few people relate with him about the challenges they are facing and he gave then the solution. You didn't know we are facing challenges then, he came during our exams, and give us two weeks ultimatum after exam to submit the project, two weeks laps you didn't know we are having challenges, Praise called him of 3rd of August, to know Dean mind which he said we should come and see him the following day, and you later called him back that he should please give us more time to submit the project and he said no problem, you now called him on 18th Of August to let him know we are having challenges with our project with how many months interval. Ok now let's assume you are in Dean's position and your student did same thing to you will you be favorable to such student?


Boss, what you did is very wrong, you can't even speak for yourself, what about others that has put their time and money to do the project, what should be their fate? 
Should it end like that?

I think I should just say this and let everybody know and I'm not scared nor afraid of anybody.

This our class lack what is called *discipline*. 
Let's look at the complain of Dean, like 70% of every Lecturer that taught us complain of such even our HOD.
 
 _I just hope there is changes in the coming session_ .

To those of us that has done our project, please don't let us  loose hope yet, I just pray Dean has a change of mind and have mercy on our time and money.
We can still look for a way to solve this issue.

 ```God bless us!
Happy Sunday!```

I think you should read my first response and grab the gist .... 

Placing more pressure on this is like trying to call your self a failure when you have not written and exam 


Sir and Ma 

Try to be rational on this matter ,doing more critical thinking ... 


Put your self in the shoes of those that have not done this project and don't truly have enough to do it ... *And sincerely reply to the issue at hand*


See for thoes aggitating on submission , *I believe it's because of the investment made in fixing theirs and probably for some the Marks attached*

*Think of it this way too*
👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

*IF YOU NEVER DO AM AND YOU DEY STRANDED WHAT WILL BE THE SOLUTION TO STILL ACHIVEING THE MAIN GOAL WHICH IS THE MARK*

☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️

If you can sincerely answer the above question ,you will be able to make a balance Judgment on the issuse 🤷🏻‍♂️

Bro , Make he no be like say I dey fight anybody ...

*My concept be say* 👉👉

*Make we look am to the right and left ,the make a good judgement*

9/27/21, 11:07 AM - +234 706 893 3394: Good morning all.... Mere going through all our conversations... My candid opinion is this...... 

Let put all our problems into writing,,, let draft a letter I mean a comprehensive one, after that we go meet HOD,,ask him, what he's doing concerning our wahala. if there's no any positive results.... Then we (all of us) move to CIDM when we show them pepper ... Maybe once or twice in a week we go there till we get positive outcome. 
And if nothing comes out of it,, then we move to central administrative building to see the Rector... 
After, if anything still doesn't comes out of it,, of which we should have get a better result before getting to rector side.. 
Then we move to the office of the Executive governor of OYO state 🌚
I think if we can follow this simple and smart procedures we should be able to get positive results on time.
Thanks...
9/27/21, 11:11 AM - Mr A'zeez Akanbi: Who write this epistle.
It's all valid but is what can be done within the department with a little push from HOD.
All we lack is coordination and prompt responds to issues.
Let meet with HOD first.
But putting it into written is key .
Highlighting all our problem for reference purpose.
@Raheem take note.
9/27/21, 11:16 AM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Mo ti ri Power Electronics and he said are you people still scared after all I have told you not to worry

But at the same time we can just draft the letter for reference purpose as supported by @2347030113738 ....
And at the same time we actually need actions not all the talks here... 
Let pick a day/date with HOD  and at the same time we need consistency... 
We should keep on hammering with onto his ears till something positive comes out of it.. 
Thanks

The staff at the EED dept said there is time frame to do that  as we all know we are doing another EED this semester and we let him know we are having issues with payment of Sch fees and he said they will have to bring something in which someone will sign and thereby u will be giving ur manual. 


So as I have said earlier this is not a matter of please oo, is a matter of if you love yourself. Do your self the favor and get ur HND1 EED LogBook before it is too late !!!

10/18/21, 12:34 PM - Adegbite Abel: how does radio communication work:

Radio works by transmitting and receiving electromagnetic waves. The radio signal is an electronic current moving back and forth very quickly. A transmitter radiates this field outward via an antenna; a receiver then picks up the field and translates it to the sounds heard through the radio.

​Lathes are one of the most versatile machine tools in the industry, used to perform a variety of machining operations.

The lathe is applied to the tool and rotated to perform various operations. It can be used for turning, tapping, forming turning, spiral cutting, finishing, passivation, boring, spinning, grinding, polishing, etc.

The main function of the lathe is to remove the material from the work piece and make the work piece the desired shape and size. During the travel of the lathe, the work piece is rotated against the tool to achieve material removal and the direction of tool movement becomes feed.

The main parts of the lathe are:

Headstock:
The headstock is usually located on the left side of the lathe and is equipped with gears, spindles, chucks, gear speed control levers, and feed controllers.

Tailstock:
Usually located on the right side of the lathe, the work piece is supported at the end.

Bed:
The main parts of the lathe, all parts are bolted to the bed. It includes the headstock, tailstock, carriage rails and other parts.

Carriage:
The carriage is located between the headstock and the tailstock and contains apron, saddle, compound rest, cross slide and tool post.

Lead Screw:
Lead screw is used to move the carriage automatically during threading.

Feed Rod:
It is used to move the carriage from left to right and vice versa.

Chip Pan:
It is present at the bottom of the lathe. Chip pan is used to collect the chips that are produced during the lathe operation.

Hand Wheel:
It is the wheel which is operated by hand to move cross slide, carriage, tailstock and other parts which has hand wheel.

Lathe machine are generally divided into three types: Engine Lathe, Turret Lathe and Special Purpose Lathe.

10/21/21, 5:58 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: *POWER ELECTRONICS RESULT UPDATE*

Special thanks to number 2 student Emi Oga @2348132027307 , @2348026882018 @2348036285935 we all paid the lecturer a visit and he told us *5-6 students get A* so we pleaded on seeing it ourselves and he said students don misuse the opportunity bcos they do come back to him that they are not pleased with the result so he has stopped showing students so I vouched for our class that no one will come and he agreed. 

After 5mins, he said he can't find it that I should come back next week.

Make una no fear, no one is coming back to re-write the course.

Thanks

After our visitation to CIDM , we are told to bring each students details on Monday please against Monday check the form thoroughly for what you might not have before then.

Also, for those who made payment and do not have a receipt, We were told that you need to visit Bursary and meet Mrs. Ajuwon for transaction code (basically a six letter /digit) which will be submitted on Monday too.

I believe everyone has been cleared, paid acceptance and should be available on Monday.

*For Payment Verification*
Call Remitta on : 07007877678

Learning should fun

Is your mechatronics option exhausting you?
Are you tired?
Do you feel like giving up?

Why give up when you can easily switch to a less exhausting option.

Why keep enduring when you can be enjoying.

With a single form and 15k you can change easily and be among the learning enjoying students

11/13/21, 1:46 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Function of *Fuel Distributor*

The Fuel Distributor meters the fuel based on engine demand (air flow), temperature, load, and emissions tuning. It also distributes the fuel to the 6 pressure-activated fuel injectors. Fuel flow is continuous, as opposed to being pulsed on and off as in modern Electronic systems.

Do you know you can learn, earn and still have fun?

Who say you can only enjoy the destination and not the journey?

I say to you today, Ladies and gentlemen, that you can enjoy both the journey and destination.

School should be educative and fun at the same time.

Join me as I introduce to you, the first of it's kind, mind blowing filled with suspense, a challenge of the fastest thinker and word users.....THE SCRABBLE CHALLENGE between IVR and AVR.

Will IVR make good use of words? will AVR make better use of it? Am curious to know🤔

There's only one way to know, a challenge..... 

Three participants needed from each option.
Venue: class auditorium
Time:8:25
Date: 15th of November 2021.

Don't miss it!!!!
The floor for betting is opened as well.

If I were you I better be ready to win, earn or have fun or do all three..


Let the countdown begins......

11/15/21, 9:12 PM - Osholake Wale: Highlights of Today's news

AMO students refused to submit their assignments to their lecturer

With shocked wrapped with excitement, a students exclaimed seeing another student enter the class. 

"Which kain wahala be this" is what some students said after facing some challenges brought by the lecturer.


It was as if they were related to buhari, because the way AMO beats IMO in the Scrabble challenge, it calls for close investigation.

11/15/21, 9:29 PM - Osholake Wale: Speed is good but direction is better, speed without direction is futile, direction without speed is fair but having both is best.

Do you know you can be financially resourceful and still not achieve your goal?

Money is important and the primary thing to have before embarking on anything, but having the right contacts and channels is more important.


Many investors lost because they partner with contacts not capable in related fields.


Partner with me today and stand the chance to travel anywhere in the world without being worried about assignments.

Why you should partner with me

Fastest access to all lecturers taking us.

Good relationship with the lecturers.

Trusted by all lecturers.

All you need to do is obtain a form for partnership which is #2500 for a month and get access to all assignments in that month and all you have to do is pay #500 weekly for submission of any assignments in that week.


Missing this offer is like a Nigerian missing a free plane to USA

This is a rare offer, don't miss it!!!!

Every sunrise is an invitation to arise and brighten someone's day and every sunset is a chance to set a smile on someone's face.


The good deeds we do out live us even after we are long gone. Good deeds are like momentum in the museum possessing artistic value and what amazes me is that even sizes don't matter, it can be small or big but it is valued.

Please let's put all hands on desk to support our colleague @2347030978296 on the laptop issue. He's a family of mechatronics and Family don't let each other down. Please let's help with anything.


Remember, it is the little things that matter most.

His account details is on the group.

I write to inform you that my days with you has been nothing but productive and my services, I tried my best. As you all know that as human being, we always want more and more. So am using this medium to relieve my self of my duties as the class Rep and student of Mechatronics effectively on the 1st of December 2021 as I have found a better offer with the North campus. Being productive is good but I want adventure as life is so short and my days are limited.
I hope you accept this with all sincerity and wish me well on my next journey as I promised to help and guide the incoming Rep who will take over.


Yours Sincerely
Osholake Ibrahim Olawale.

I hereby fine a charge of N155,239.75 on @2348026882018 for confusing we the future leaders of Scrabble about the placement of the board.

This charge can only be taken of if there is a law stating the placement, it's been used by expertise in the field.

Thank You.

12/31/21, 10:25 AM - +234 817 959 4137: I Ended My Career!

Today being the 31st of December 2021 marks the end of my career in the university as a staff.

I joined the Federal University of OYE EKITI February 10th 2020 and I resigned today after 3 months mandatory notice.

I love academics, I like impacting knowledge and researching a lot but I am currently putting a hold on that for now and I will be announcing my next steps on Day 1 of 2022.

I would like to thank all my colleagues, and my ogas that I have been privileged to work with and under. I am equally grateful for the students that I have been privileged to teach, I wouldn't forget everything you did for me and all that we did together. 

I hope to return to class someday soon as it is part of my blood but for now it would be limited to my YouTube channel https://lnkd.in/dvFremiC and some other dedicated online classes.

Grateful to everyone who has been part of my journey, this side of my career goes down with 2021.

Regards.

1/1/22, 11:08 AM - +234 806 323 0404: Where's the next step from here. I suppose this should be our last year together as classmates, friends and colleagues. Well... Just a little reminder about this great course. I guess we all don't know the value yet.. in England and the united states right now. They are massively looking for mechatronics engineers, IT guru's and finance guru's.. over there... Will this be the end of our journey..
My dear friends let's keep furthering on our education.. thank God for the numerous scholarship on master's level . Education is the center for decision making in one's life... Let's keep furthering on together... If you know any way of assisting a friend in job hut, academics or any thing of good importance.. don't let us hesitate in helping.. nice meeting y'all. I pray our friendship still continues after this year.. Don't say because school na scam. I won't further on.. pls bag this degree's upon degree's..  
I really welcome y'all into this new year of divine upliftment and great achievements..

1/13/22, 9:55 AM - Tobi Mechatronics: Okay 👌
1/13/22, 9:56 AM - Osholake Wale: Good morning everyone.
First of all I apologize to  everyone for all this coming up about this Dean project.

To avoid been bias and putting ourselves in other people shoes, I know most people will find it hard not to submit this project after they've worked so hard for it, I know it's hard. But I believe we are family and we should be united all time with one voice and when we first resumed I saw this unity and honestly I loved it so much, even on our exam day when some of us couldn't come to exam for some reasons, I saw how we all united to write the exam in a time not convenient for most people but we sacrificed our convenience for the Mechatronics Family. I want us to the same thing concerning this Dean project. I begged those who has done the projects and are ready to submit to please not submit. If we are united nothing can happen to us but if we are divided so many things can happen. We are family and we should act like one please..

My conclusion is we are not submitting it.
And I apologized sincerely to those who dedicated their time, money and effort to their project and still won't be submitting, please don't be angry🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

1/13/22, 2:25 PM - Olapade Isiah2: @2349053972627  to utter dis kind of words '' I salute ur weakness" is somehow bad.
And why do you kept mute when u was in class yesterday, for u to be now saying all dis here.
1/13/22, 2:43 PM - Tobi Mechatronics: <Media omitted>
1/13/22, 2:43 PM - Tobi Mechatronics: Please DEAN IS NOW AROUND
1/13/22, 2:47 PM - +234 905 397 2627: Papa... I salute you ,

For the first ...it's only to date that I respect such weakness ,because that's a big way to help a person depending on how we all see things .... 

If I can stand for something behind a crowd and can't stand for it before a crowd ..it shows a part of the kind of weakness I have ...  

Aside this every one including me have their weaknesses but we work on them to be a better person ....  

The above sentence is a problem and a solution granted to the conversation with Dean yesterday ..... I only call a spade a spade and not a shovel . .  

I never expected any to get offended ,but because when an unclear  conversation goes beyond just one mind it can lead to strive ..this might be unavoidable (  I carefully selected those words and truly mean no harm ) 


Sir 

Keeping quiet is a secret power to making good critical decision ..... And that was my best way to say no before the Dean ( if we all keeper quiet about this yesterday and think of a better approach before responds we will definitely be saved from all we find here on the group today ) 

I consider not only today or me in my decision but also tomorrow and others 

To be honest with you Sir  I'll be foolish to agitate that  in front of  the Dean yesterday ..... ( Some are saying we are going to submit.then I front of the same Dean am saying because of those that have not done it we will not submit ... It's not even going to work when some already have the mindset of a +3mark .... 

I silence on that conversation would have helped us yesterday ...,( My treason for keeping quite knowing that we have concluded on closing that chapter last year  )

Concerning MTH last class only three people were around and the man taught the three of us so to share with others and computer class there's a need for tutorial.

So I want you guys to pick a day convenient for the tutorial, Monday and Tuesday is out of option so we are left with Wednesday and Thursday. So I want you all to pick a day. 
Thanks
1/15/22, 11:59 AM - Tobi Mechatronics: Please for who ever will take us should kindly prepare for others topic we have been taught in MTH this semester (so that people that has been absent in all of the classes can get along to)

so that we will know we are done with MTH and if you can help us get some past questions on this course we will be glad 

Tenk U 
My own side of the story 🤓

Any day is convenient for me 
Will just suggest the time should be 10/11am so that we can cover all the topics in MTH

According to information at my disposal, Poly Ibadan won’t take your credentials to Jamb office for Regularization till they have 500 copies ie 500 students submit theirs.

What we need is WAEC Result, JAMB Result and ~10k sha.

We’re going on Wednesday 10am.

We move from department.

Thank you.

1/19/22, 9:56 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: talk what ?

1/19/22, 9:59 PM - Tobi Mechatronics: And that is what am saying, HOD Can’t say that he his not aware of his non-chalante attitude
1/19/22, 10:00 PM - AbdulLateef zean2: You just wan stress me. 🥺

@2348166743390  yes it's very difficult to interact with him, but based on how I know him.

And if it doesn't work then escalate.

1/20/22, 1:26 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: *Programming Update 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼*
1/20/22, 1:27 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: *Exam is a true test of knowledge, none of you made that to reflect except Kike. What you don't know is if I fail you guys, I will be challenged for this but you all decided to take the fastest route yourself.. After the exam, I was expecting some or you to tell me how hard or how you were unable to write the exam well but no one showed up only for you to be boasting that we beat the exam well....*

*After a lengthy talk, we concluded at writing a make-up test with the following criteria*

1. The test will be over 20 and whatever you score will be recorded for Mid-Sems , I pleaded that if someone fails, he should leave the current Mid Sems and he said NO

2. Attendance was never used, C.A might take form of attendance, participation in class and assignment.

I told him we will decide if we want this and I will get back to him today.

Thanks
1/20/22, 1:28 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: I expect feedbacks 😊

1/20/22, 2:43 PM - Mr A'zeez Akanbi: I just want us all to be calm and address this issue maturely.
Everybody feeling is not the same and interaction with lecturers are different. 
We should avoid loggerhead with any lecturer as they might gang up and focus on mechantronics which might lead to.mass failure.
Which we all might not like at the end of the programme.
If there is what he can do,I advice we approach him maturely and solve the issue if possible. 
So please guys don't confront any lecturer because of exam record.

*Dear Fellow Students,*

I know you are the best, don't feel nervous. Be confident and calm. You can do it. 

*Examination Rules/Guide*

✳️ Shun Malpractice (don't go in with incriminating stuffs such as scripted paper, airpod, phones, digital wrist watch and many more..)

✳️ Bring your own writing material such as pen, pencil, eraser, calculator...

✳️ Be at the examination venue 30minutes before commencement.

However, I have informed @2348166743390 regarding this and am expecting us tomorrow to apologize.

Thanks!
2/2/22, 9:32 PM - AbdulRauf Taofeek: And I replied you that it’s only if it’s going to influence the score that I will beg him 

I didn’t confront him to show myself it’s basically to do something to the exam scores
2/2/22, 9:32 PM - Tobi Mechatronics: Yes he said that his the only reason our result can be modified, if not there is nothing he can do, 
Because it will be as if he his in support of what we did

I don't know if we realise the fear of speaking up against our leaders (the bad once) is what get us into the shit we are in this country already 

The once that speak for us will still not get our backing

Las las we go dey suffer and smile

The case will have been very much different if its not just bee-jay that talked that day 
At least few other people were present that day but no una go talk for your benefit
Had it been that everyone speaker up that day the case will be different at least he will reason it small say *e get as e be*

I'm not saying this so that anyone can change cos I know for a fact that we can't change... but if you wan dey silent dey silent, if you wan talk, talk..

Imagine for almost an hour, 99% of AVR population has not written anything we were just looking like person wey dem collect in bread. All hope to use chips and micro processors end up futile. Even supervisors even laugh at us... It seems like they are sent to us... Even @2349033024846  @2347054841038 the ladies were unhappy yesterday. This can't continue to go on. We really need to do something about it as soon as possible. AVR LIFE MATTERS OO

2/3/22, 8:46 AM - Tobi Mechatronics: Generally this semester exam is a bit tough due to the fact that all hands are on desk over our matter

I implored us that the change in exam mode should not create any division between us.
It will lead us know where,we have few month to go and the bond we have created for the past 2 years should not be shattered away.
Let continue to hold hand together as we normally do.
GOD will help us and see us through.
This stage will pass away and new chapter will emerge but the experience remains for ever.
Move today again.

2/11/22, 3:31 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: *SPECIAL RECOGNITION*

For every beginning there's always a predestined ending, for every journey embarked, there's always a predestined destination.
To live is to impact others.

It is with a bittersweet heart I announce the departure of our amazing lecturer, a father figure, a role model, an exceptional teacher, a hardworking man, a man with great reputation, the person of *MR OLARENLE* who will be vacating his seat on Monday for better offer. 

It is our prayer to the ALMIGHTY that in his new journey, may he find Mercy, blessing, grace, happiness, purpose, Joy and Fulfilment. It is our wish that when we see again, we will have laughter in our mouth and Joy in our heart, happiness in our soul and lots of good memories to share.

*Thanks for all You do Mr. Olanrele*

In my attempt to see the mechanical lecturer taking AMO this semester I met with Fabrication lecturer and he said he's done marking automotive exam and they did well except one or two who scored below 20 while the rest of AMO scored above 20 and above 30.

He said he's just marking the industrial exam and so far they didn't performed well enough though he is still marking sha.

Baba adio is still the one taking AMO the two mechanical courses we are taking this semester

3/13/22, 10:25 AM - +234 813 025 2686: I was listening to Rev Sunday Adelaja this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and I learnt a very  good lesson which every Nigerian in diaspora must learn, whether you go North, East, West or South, home is the best.

Sunday Adelaja has been living in Ukraine for 35 years. He arrived in Ukraine when he was 19 years and is 55 years old now.

All his investments are in Ukraine and he never saw any need to get a property in Nigeria or any other place.

He did not anticipate that an unforseen war with Russia would drive him and his family away from Kyev, Ukraine. 

For the first time in his life he became homeless and had to depend on friends to hide his family. Now he's in hiding and can't even come to Nigeria because he has no investments in Nigeria.

Fellow Classmates ,no matter your status in a foreign land, remember that you are first a Nigerian before any other thing, and just as the Polish denied entry to all blacks, including black Ukrainian citizens from entering their country, except Slovakia, which has been so magnanimous to accept all comers. 

No one knows when our citizenship of a foreign country will be questioned and when our foreign passport becomes worthless. What would you do? 

A Pharaoh will arrive one day and doesn't know Joseph and your stay in a foreign land becomes shaky!

What would you do to protect your family from racial profiling and abuse?

Nigeria might today have a lot of problems but it is our country and I know my way in Nigeria more than any other country. I still miss the noise of Oshodi, Ojuelegba, the  serenity of ikoyi and the nice the food. 

It is incumbent on every Nigerian in diaspora to make investment at home a priority. Don't put all your eggs in one basket to avoid coming back home empty handed after many years of labor. 

If Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, could spend over 5 billion dollars on the British economy in the last twenty years and his assets are being frozen for a crime he didn't commit, who are you my brother Segun, from Ijebu ijesha to think that because you have a British Passport, they cannot get rid of you anytime they want?

A word is enough for the wise! 

Fear man, fear white people.

I'm meant to disseminate this information since Yesterday but activities much on my desk.

We met with the HOD and he said before marking any course form, you should see him first.

Don't submit any course form at his back most especially if you have a re-run in a course.

Thanks.

Solidarity greetings to all students.

The Students Union body uses this medium to extend Ramadan greetings to all our Muslim brothers and sisters; may this period bring happiness,comfort and joy to us and the entire institution.

*We urge all students to stay at home for now till our resolutions are being met,*  

Obviously,Adedeji Adedamola Abdulazeez led administration has made students welfarism a priority and will not relent until normalcy is restored in all ramifications on campus; standard security teams as well as conducive learning environment for students is our right and not privilege 

The SUG body implores us all to kindly and positively bear with us on this decision. 

Thanks for your understanding.

4/12/22, 8:50 AM - Mr A'zeez Akanbi: I called the MTH lecturer Mr Olatunji this morning to know our fate concerning our last semester exam, he said " we didn't perform well compared to last previous one we did, he said only few did well", I plead with him telling him to consider the fact that this is our last year and finals, he further said "How about people didn't write anything, what help can he render to such person". Then I asked him when I can come check the results, he said on Thursday I should call him but unfortunately I won't be around on Thursday but I will make the call.

This is the update I want to share with everyone.
4/12/22, 8:53 AM - Abiodun Ridwan: All our we do am come lead to , we didn't perform
4/12/22, 8:53 AM - Mr A'zeez Akanbi: @2349033024846 @2349031335109 @2348181727547 @2348026882018 kindly deliberate and come up with option give and take for the guy and let face front.
Cooperate now and avoid coming alone next year for MTH that you can just use a token to close the gap ASAP.

This is the latest so far

It’s high time we need to compliment our capacity president @2349033024846 efforts regarding our registration issues.

According to the academic calendar we didn’t have up to two months in school. we have all struggled to pay necessary fees, school management shouldn’t denial us our right.

Please I urge us all to come together  and archive this unity of purpose because if our academics session is over we won’t have this unity again.

Let agitate for our right peacefully✌🏽

4/26/22, 7:04 PM - +234 803 628 5935: UPDATE ON TODAY'S MEETING.

Good evening everyone, I hope we all had a great day. 
Concerning our meeting today, after the staff speakers spoke, Mechatronics students were the first to raise their hands in order to pour out their. The first speak, spoke on behalf of NAMTES and in his expression, he touched all aspects of the problems we were facing. The staff speaker tried to play on our intelligence and further try to detach the DSA (Directorate of student affairs) from the management of the institution, he tried making some pointless point on how to direct our issues to the right people which was already done many times, we informed him as well that those things he afore mentioned was done already. Another speaker from Mechatronics as well spoke with a tone that expressed our grievance more, and that we can't take it anymore. Other students from various department were astonished with their mouth and eye wide opened hearing our matter, murmurs filled the hall fast like a released gas released to the atmosphere. The staff speakers were not ready to listen to our plea and dance to our tunes, we then walked out angrily and 90% of the students there from various department walked out with us.
We then continue our journey and head to CIDM to speak with MR KENNY, whom they said he's not around, we met with a woman, who tried to calm us down and pretended to know and understand what we are going. She asked us to come back next week that our issues will be resolved but we know within ourselves that's a truthful lie, students from Mechanical department met us there with the woman as they also came to express their, grievance, they were super shocked hearing our matter again. We then decided to head back to the department to regroup and plan as we can't talk about out plan in the house of our enemy. Some left but most of us went back to the department and we've made plans and arrangements which will be discussed tomorrow after the MTH Test.
The conclusion of the matter is the management is playing politics with us and gambling on our future, and a countermeasure must be taken as well.

NOTE AFTER EXAM WE HAVE NO MORE POWER, THEREFORE WE HAVE TILL BEFORE EXAM TO SORT OUR ISSUE AND WE NEED EVERYONE TO BE AVAILABLE.

PLEASE WHILE COMING TOMORROW, PUT ON A COOPERATE DRESS OR PUT ON SHOES AND COME WITH YOUR NOSE MASK.

Special Thanks to everyone who showed up today and to those who made this Journey possible, you're all appreciated and honored.
To those who were not around too for some reason or the other, you are all appreciated as well, we expect you all in school as soon as possible.

Good Night.
Love and Light.

4/27/22, 5:53 PM - +234 706 893 3394: Kudos to everyone, I love this spirit, never too late to fight.

I met with the School Representative handling our score sheet to brief her about the course form progress and also met with HOD later today and he said we didn't even tell him we went out to cause chaos yesterday.

However, he said, una Weldone , ensure to dress responsibly to avoid stories.

Tomorrow, we continue... The struggle is for us all, the fact that you have a course form doesn't mean you should stay back...

 I also have mine now and my Baby does 🥰 ( *Reason why you must be an Emi OGA* ).

To All AVR Students, @2347054841038 has related with Engr. Adio regarding why we were absent from class today.

We will keep the fight on.... And don't forget to pray for @2348166117734 🙏🙏🙏🙏

When we got to Iwo road, the sister updated us that they already left the hospital to where he will be buried. We doubt if we would meet up with the Janaza(Burial). We had no choice than to abort the journey.  By the grace of God, we’ll reschedule the movement. We thank you all for the support. May God continue to spare our life and may we not die in our prime.

When despair for the world grows in him🧑‍🍼.
He come into the presence of still water💦
feel above him the day-blind stars ⭐, waiting with their light🕯️.
For a time he rest in the grace of the world🧖,
and now free🕺.
Let them be the only one to keep you from the cold🌬️,
Now the floor of heaven🌁 is laid, the stars🌟 are bright as gold
They light🕯️for him, they shine 🌅for him
They all burn🌋  to see him.
Go into those arms🫂 and set your spirit free🕺 
Outside were the eucalyptus trees🌱, like lace against the sky☁️, If it were only possible to lie against them, light 🕯️ and bodiless 🛌, sink into their softness, deeper and deeper, lost in them and  buried, never come back 🚶again, cause you are part of them in the Savage Garden 🏡, and the light🕯️ that went out of  life 🧬 would come back in a great burst of glory🎇🎆. Out of mortal flesh🧑‍🦱 you would pass into eternity☄️☄️☄️
REST ON ABISOYE LATEEF 😭😭😭

5/3/22, 12:53 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: *Advise to all Men* 

1. You cannot settle all financial expenses in one day. Those who did are stressfully sick and some are buried already.

2. Please create time to rest, it is not a sin to sit down , put up your legs on the table and pick popcorn whilst reading a book or just relaxing

3. Please sleep if need be that headache will go. Those who refuse to take vacation, or leave, or time out or rest time, their families are missing them because they have gone untimely to their maker.

4. Stop taking sedatives to sleep, you are destroying your brain and organs. At a point you will begin to forget things. Relax the brain , worry less, think less, laugh more , smile more. Everything will pass with time. 

5. Sometimes go and sit outside quietly on your own, do nothing say nothing , just admire God's handiwork, breathe in fresh air calmly. Hurry not.

6. Stand by your mirror smile to yourself, laugh , dance, sing, that turns on a positive aura around you so you can glow.

7. Go buy yourself a snack or two with drink if you choose to do so. Just do something for yourself, so you offload the things in your head.

8. If you are not feeling well say it , do something about it, go to health centre, hospital or call a nearby nurse, do not sit around, your life matters .

9. Check your blood pressure and sugar level occasionally, whether you are sick or not. It has saved a lot of men in the past. Trust me on this.

Remember to share with all the men you love and let them enjoy life in good health and abundance.

Gentlemen this is a reminder to all of us. 

*We are important and must take care of ourselves.*

Satisfaction🧏 lies in the effort💪, not in the attainment🤦 cause falling inside the water💦 don't make you drown🏊; you drown by staying there.
In life🏯 success consists of going🚶from failure 😩to failure😩 without loss of enthusiasm🕺 cause Failure😩 is the opportunity to begin🧎 again more intelligently🤯, The pressure😰 you feel right now can feel like a huge weight that you’re dragging🏋️. But remember🧏, just a few more of these nights🌌 and you’re done! 🤝, stay focused and keep head up.
wishing us all success in forth coming Exams.

5/11/22, 9:30 PM - Adegbite Abel: No one is interviewing you.

You already dropped the idea even before it kicked off and you’re here today painting it like no one responded but that’s by the way.

To think that 3 out of 5 that respond didn’t support and @2347030113738 had to order neck straightener to be able to face front.
5/11/22, 9:31 PM - Adegbite Abel: The same one you said you’re not contributing 😂
5/11/22, 9:32 PM - Adegbite Abel: @2348036285935 came the next day and said she’s in.

If we really wanted to get the money, I believe @2348181727547 is a super human that knows how to do it and we won’t be here frightening over GNS 😂

This is not a conclusion .

You are saying no one is deciding for anyone and asking everyone to pay #500

What for?

Conclusion should be everybody write, everybody pay.

We cant have just a few people write and others not.

Cant we all be united?

Its either we all write or we all dont write.

5/12/22, 9:04 AM - Akpan ThankGod: Last semester exam abi?
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - Osholake Wale: Money isn't everything but it is needed in every thing, that's constant.
Everyone also has a price but all prices isn't in monetary form as well.
I have no issue with paying and am sure most people as well.
But my first question is do we really know this man?
Do we recall what happened with power when we were asking for a chance to glance on our results?
What if our monetary approach will stir up anger in him?
What it worsen it?
I have seen this man in some scenarios and my conclusion about him is he doesn't need money to be a good man or pass us.
He understands us, he knows what a fail could do to us at this moment.
A statement he made when I inquire about our results a particular time was "omo Dada niyin and I have no reasons to treat you bad"

So my suggestion is we all attend his class tomorrow, if possible all, and tell him this exam we are about to write is not so sure because we only attended two classes due to the fact that we couldn't find a lecturer on time and if he asks about the two classes we miss, we tell him we lost a Friend and brother, may God rest his soul and we are battling for our course forms. I am sure he will be considerate to pass us either the previous exam or this forthcoming one. I am certain.
We will all see our results and smile.
This is my humble suggestion
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - Omowunmi Samson Dreý: Be like so + this one wae we wan write

Please note, the MCE 422 (Production Management) examination will come up on Day 2, Tuesday (10/05/2022), instead of Thursday.

And MCE 423 (Quality Assurance) slated for Tuesday will come up on Day 4, Thursday (12/05/2022).

This is to make sure Quality Assurance examination comes up on the same day with Mechanical Engineering students.

Good evening guys, I called the HOD to ask how far about the examination and he said examination will continue tomorrow, and for the exams that did not hold today has been postponed till the third week which means it will come as the last paper for the people doing the courses that was supposed to written today.

Civil Engineering president also called his own HOD too to confirm from him and he said the same thing, they 2 HOD said according to their meeting, if we fail to write the examination now, it will take 2 months before the examination commence again. 

So pls guys I urge u all to be ready because exams might come up on Wednesday for FENG students, dnt loose guard ooo because we dnt knw the plan of the management yet… 

Examination starts tomorrow for the other faculties

*_The Polytechnic, Ibadan_*

20th of may, 2022

To: _All Part Time Students_

Solidarity greetings to all *Part Time* students of this greatest citadel of learning. 

    Sequel to the memo that goes viral earlier today, stating that exam will commence on 23th of may 2022, *Part Time Students Coordinators implore all part time students, to step aside as the memo 📝 was only meant for Full Time and Dpp not PT.*

Part Time examination will be recall back immediately after the full time finish with their exam, as majority of Part Time refuse to pay their tution fee.

*NB: Only students that has fully paid will be allow to write exam and Executives will not fight for the rest as the centre had given golding opportunity for students to pay but unfortunately they refuse to utilize the opportunity, If only 2 students have paid in a particular department only the students will be allow to write the exam while the rest will face the consequences of their action.*

"Settlement is better than embarrassment"

In this exam only GNS and MTH requires you to do something at all cost 


 if you don't know what to write and its difficult to use anything in the exam 

just submit and see the lecturer after the exam instead of getting caught by external supervisors 

Department don't usually fail their student in final exam

5/30/22, 7:58 AM - Mr A'zeez Akanbi: WAKE UP QUOTE 
Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its whole life believing that it is stupid.” – Albert Einstein

Exams are not for everyone.
You could be the brightest bulb in the box and still not shine as brightly in exams. The outcome of an exam will not define you and your intelligence At all.

Always understand that if you struggle in one area, you’re not bad at everything.

Everybody is good at something but no one is good at everything.

Wishing you all success

Everything we need is always with us... you're/we are not forced to sit where we usually sit during exam.. it's you that will find your sitting partner, so for this reason I don't think there's any other reason why you have to be calling people in distance if at all you need help talk to your neighbour 

Pls for the sake of someone like me that always find it hard to read for someone's else's book during exam pls STOP THE SHOUTING DURING EXAM, it really makes it difficult

Pls join this group for more information on the signing out and partying
6/2/22, 9:59 PM - Popoola Tolulope: Good evening everyone, 
This is an apology from me to everyone who has been expecting the sign-out jacket. Sincerely, I tried all I could to get it done. But responses from people who wants to make them are not satisfactory.

We had to cancel the production of the varsity jacket. Because they refuse to make a sample and it'll be a very bad Idea to proceed with the sales of  what I'm not sure of. 

Meanwhile the signout white is stull very much on. And it'll cost just #2500 to get one. Please payment can start coming in. Thanks 

Please kindly accept my sincere apologies. One love

6/6/22, 9:30 PM - Abiodun Ridwan: IN SHORT TIME🕑🕑🕑
It may be the end 🔚of our study 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓here in this great school🏫, It is now dawn on me🚶 that we have to say goodbye👋, goodbye to all the laughter🤣 and the pain😭 we shared together🫂, I don’t know how to express 😫my feelings right now, I felt as if I’m going into an empty world🌍 out there. It is definitely the toughest time⏱️ for me. But still, let keep the contact alive, let not forget one another when we leave here
I wish we  had many more years to spend together for we shall meet again🤝, When we're least expecting it, One day in some far-off place, we will recognize our faces, we won't say goodbye my friends, For you and I will meet again."Words cannot express how saddened my heart is each time I remember in a bit we will soon bid farewell to each other, this isn't the end,it a new beginning, I looked up in the sky and all around the school surroundings and I realized that we will soon be leaving here, May the road rise up to meet us, may the wind be ever at our back. May the sun shine warm upon our face and the rain fall softly on our fields. And until we meet again, may God hold us in the hollow of his hand."

6/17/22, 3:46 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: For clearance, you can actually photocopy the clearance form from a friend, or get another copy from Student Affairs, then the offices where you need stamping are indicated there (e.g sport office, hostel), each of those office you might need to pay a token of about NGN200 max. 

But when yiu get to department, you’d pick up a preclearance from HODs office, that your Project Supervisor and Cordinator  will sign before HOD will append his signature. ( but during this time your results will be ready before HoD can sign) so you may start and take a pause till your result is ready. 

After HOD signs, you’d take it to Bursary and make a payment- For Notification of Result + Alumni, if you’re lucky, yiu may not be ask to pay Alumni, but usually it’ll be asked, after then, you take it back to students affairs and then they’ll receive it and give you a slip in exchange which you’d take to exams and records for your notification of result.

6/20/22, 7:58 PM - Oye..Barnabas: @2349033024846, @2348181727547, @2349031335109 , @2348026882018 .

Please I have a very important question to ask.
Right from HND 1 that we have been contributing money for the invigilators, is it everybody that use to pay the money?
And has the lecturers task us that this is the particular amount that we must bring to them?

I'm just asking because it has been disturbing me ever since I have been seeing this message, to the extent that less than 10 people are now delaying us in making progress with our registration, score sheet and some school vital issue.

One thing I believe is that not all group work are 100 percent accurate, if we continue to drag it from now till next year, some people will not pay, some did it intentional and some it is due to financial issue, so we can't blame anybody.
Someone like me, it was my roommate @2348100190658 that eventually pay for me when he knows I don't have the money and it is not intentional.

So please whatever we have on ground let's distribute to the lecturer in other not to waste our time regarding the scoresheet.

Thank you🙏🏻
6/20/22, 8:02 PM - Oye..Barnabas: At least we have more than 80% people that has pay, please let's move on and do the necessary things..
6/20/22, 8:05 PM - Omowunmi Samson Dreý: Hmmmm
6/20/22, 8:17 PM - Osholake Wale: Good evening @2348062794852 , trust you're doing fine. Concerning this, I don't have a straight and accurate answer to your question because I don't know about how the payments go down, like am not in charge but all I can say is am very sure not all students pays and I agree with you that you're right and that those that hasn't paid shouldn't delay or affect our progress concerning our pending necessary school issues. I got to find out today that some students are done with their clearance and whereas we haven't even started our registration.

Let me call your attention to something, which is the fact that we are alone in this fight and nobody is coming to rescue us except we save ourselves. After all said and done, the DSA couldn't even lift a finger concerning our issue, that is to tell us that he is just mouthed and his words can't be held onto.

In order to avoid not been mobilized with our colleagues, I strongly recommend and advice @2349033024846 to proceed with the necessary steps to be taken and forget about those yet to pay.

♥️✌🏽
6/20/22, 8:19 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Next session starts August 😂
6/20/22, 8:21 PM - Oye..Barnabas: Are you saying as the class rep, you don't know payment is done, who is now giving those lecturer money?
Maybe @2348181727547 will.

But Sha act fast on it please.
6/20/22, 8:22 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: @2348026882018  is less concerned about Payment distribution.

Let everyone do the needful and we move ahead.
6/20/22, 8:23 PM - Oye..Barnabas: 👆
You're out rep during HND 1 that's why I tag you.
Please respond to this.
6/20/22, 8:25 PM - Osholake Wale: Not really, I am aware we are paying but am not detailed enough to know how many people paid and did not and also how it is being paid
6/20/22, 8:26 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Moreso, payment distribution goes beyond Me alone.

Call those holding us back, let them do the needful.

For a whole 8weeks, 1k faaaah.... Everyone get wetin dem dey face, as I dey  laidiz, I don't have 1k but when things are meant to be done for our progress, we need to do and forget about it.
6/20/22, 8:26 PM - Oye..Barnabas: Why is he less concerned?

more than 80% has done the needful so it's like everyone has play their part.

We can't wait for less than 10 people out of 45 student.
6/20/22, 8:26 PM - Osholake Wale: Please at this stage I think we should forget about those who haven't paid and move on
6/20/22, 8:29 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Who pays for them....? Will you ?
6/20/22, 8:30 PM - +234 803 628 5935: @2348026882018 pls check ur DM
6/20/22, 8:31 PM - Oye..Barnabas: Boss, this is group not individual that you can boast of yourself.

And besides, did those lecturers task us that this is the particular amount we must bring or they know how much we are contributing?

If they didn't pay, leave them alone, it is left to them, those that had paid has sacrifice for them

Simple.
6/20/22, 8:32 PM - +234 706 893 3394: Make I check something for hia....

6/20/22, 8:33 PM - Osholake Wale: Alright ma
6/20/22, 8:34 PM - Oye..Barnabas: Imagine, our rep is saying he doesn't know how the money is being distributed.

This is not fair enough!

6/20/22, 8:39 PM - Oluwatayo Raheem: Alayeeee, what's not fair enough....?

Distribution of fund has nothing to do with either you are a class Rep or not.

@2349031335109 has no idea of how it's been distributed either.

Also, there are some lecturer I don't pay directly either cos we don't have more interaction.

All this you are digging up has nothing to do with Post you are holding in the class.

6/30/22, 8:59 AM - +234 808 347 9965: Good morning Sir(s) n Ma(s), I think we are taking ourselves for granted, if our HOD can go for 2k, why is Dean money going for 2.5k, pls we can still consider ourselves, don't just let us be calling this money like we are all plucking this money, even if you are working for it, it is still your sweat.

Let us try and check things out with us n b  calming down, giving Dean 50k I think is not bad or the whole house should go for 1.5k. because we all have registration to do, HND 1 n HND 2, we are giving him something just to say thank you Sir, but this amount won't have been too much if we have been saying it long before, although if we are to look at it, it is not much considering the fact that we are talking about all of our results but, we still have to put even to the least person into consideration, "BOYS ARE NOT SMILING"...

I'm so sorry for not appreciating our serving leaders first, for you guys have really done allot, I'm not condemning what you have done but pls let us refrained somethings and pls adjust the money.

Some of us haven't pay our 5H, till now, yet we are and we are still adding up again. We shouldn't forget that we are all doing our project and project defense we will still pay again, allot and allot to pay for. Pls helps go back to the drawing board and readjust the amount.

Thanks

This is a good point but what I think this person did not realize is that HOD did not request for this but dean requested for it in one way or the other( no arguments on this please ) and where this will be applicable is that we will continue to have HOD on our good side of our mind  even in future but hardly can we put dean in mind after he has given us our result

7/22/22, 10:11 AM - +234 703 097 8296: *STEPS AND MATERIALS FOR EARLY CAMP PREPARATION*
                                                                             
                                                                                                                            
 1. Prepare Your Mind: 
First and foremost, you need to prepare your mind that you are leaving home for a regimented life in the camp. Life in the camp is deliberately made stressful so as to prepare you for any challenge that may confront you outside the camp. You will not find it too comfortable; it’s a camp and not your Father’s house! Just be ready for anything.

 2. Itemize All Your Needs Using A Scale of Preference (very important ones first): 

1. Very Important Ones
 a. Statement of Result/Certificate
 b. School ID card
 c. Passport photographs (10 copies, white background, Surplus is better than inadequacy)
 d. Call-Up Letter (Do Not laminate it please)
 e. Medical Certificate of Fitness indicating your health status with NMA stamp
 f. A Clear Bag file (To house the above items)
NB: Get photocopies each of items A,B,D and E above and also go with their Original copies also.

2. Other Important Ones (For your Convenience)
 a. Stationeries; pen, Stapler, pin, gum, permanent marker (these will save you the stress of ‘borrow-me’ please)
 b. Two or three white T-shirts and shorts (You will be given two sets but you may not like the quality and size)
 c. Two or three pairs of socks and white rubber tennis shoes (for rainy days)
 d. Plastic bucket (You can buy it in the camp but it will be more expensive)
 e. Toiletries Essentials-(Toothbrush & Toothpaste, Bath soap & Sponge, Detergent, Toilet Paper, Towel,  slippers, detol).
 f. Bed sheet, pillow case, wrapper, one or two pairs of casual wear for Sundays and burn fire night, Cardigan (not compulsory)
g. Face Mask (this you will also be given not condom) 
h. Mosquito Net (not compulsory)
i. Handkerchiefs (very important especially for those that sweat)
 j. Waist bag (very very important for housing your phones,
ID Cards, Handkerchief, biros, etc)
 k. Small-sized Torchlight/Rechargeable lamp (small one please) and Sunglasses (If you are posted to the North especially in this coming season)
l. Your ATM card(s) (note: some camps don't have atm so prepare for pos charges) 
m. food flask, cup, spoon, water bottle for water during parade.
n. Basic drug like Panadol, Paracetamol, malaria drug,flagyl, pain relief drug and/other basis drugs. (note: all drugs can will be checked before entering and hard drug is not allowed) 
o. Padlocks and key
p. Ladies could add any other few conveniences. I believe you understand me.
q. Money! Money! Money! Hold good cash please 20k to 30k depending on how you spend.

Note: that sharp object, rides or pet will not be allowed, and also not that we said basic drugs not unnecessary or hard ones

For those just leaving camp, what in this list do you thinks is not needed, so we can remove 
it?

7/22/22, 1:34 PM - +234 706 893 3394: *UPDATE FOR AVR*

If you are seeing Course forward in your course form, No problem, it's normal because the department is yet to submit our Result to CIDM hence the system is seeing it as a *RE-RUN* course.

You can proceed to submit but be sure all courses you did in HND 2 first semester is there and select appropriately if you are not removing any course.

*If you have a RE-RUN, do not submit.*

7/27/22, 11:33 AM - +234 706 893 3394: The date naani...
7/27/22, 11:33 AM - Osholake Wale: IVR course is a compound course and all it's content can't be covered in the span of two years, therefore a need for an additional one year for the IVR student is mandatory before they can be issued a certificate.

HND 3 is waiting for IVR, you all should feel honored to be breaking a new record in the polytechnic Ibadan.
So chill and worry less about course forms and score sheet as it will be sorted before the end of your program.
