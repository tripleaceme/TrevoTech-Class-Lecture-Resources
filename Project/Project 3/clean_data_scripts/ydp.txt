I just launched this package on PyPi - Slik-wrangler.

It's a library that helps with data preprocessing with the aim of reducing the time between preprocessing and modelling, and give you time to focus on other areas of your data science project.


You can install the library and try it out. Would really love your feedbacks.

Here's the link to further info about the project.

5/7/22, 9:56 PM - +234 816 484 7452: @2348108522573 I didn’t know MDS dates as far back as 2013-2014
5/7/22, 9:57 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes actually 

MDS as a concept got launched with the advent of Cloud infrastructure with AWS in 2012
5/7/22, 9:58 PM - +234 802 755 7589: @2348108522573 , check DM
5/7/22, 9:58 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
Looking at general adoption, the pace is slow
5/7/22, 9:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Majority of the tools in the MDS stack were developed around that period. 

But it got a wide adoption in 2016 with dbt

5/7/22, 9:59 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Now that Knowledge Graphs are out there, it would take another 6-7 years to blow up in Nigeria before we actually dive into its numerous possibilities
5/7/22, 10:00 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Like Graphical SQLs?
5/7/22, 10:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It’s beyond that actually
5/7/22, 10:00 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Be like say I don snooze
5/7/22, 10:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It is defining the scope of a business as a Graph with intelligence in it.

Why because it is easier to transverse a typical graph database than the relational one.

Instead of building normal data models, you build graph data models and graph schemas.
5/7/22, 10:02 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Companies making waves here that you can look at includes 

RelationalAI, Neo4J and TigerGraph
5/7/22, 10:02 PM - +234 708 145 1890: At least I know the last 2.
5/7/22, 10:03 PM - +234 802 755 7589: This time last year, I never even know wetin be dbt much less the concept MDS.
5/7/22, 10:03 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Never knew it had transcended to this.

Woow... I knew Graphical Databases had so much potential, but it would be late before it comes to Nigeria.

5/7/22, 10:08 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Nah
Some companies who operate with Silicon Valley standards are already using Graph databases and some have knowledge Graphs already but not on a large scale
5/7/22, 10:09 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It is in Nigeria already

I know one person here who has the skill
5/7/22, 10:09 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
5/7/22, 10:09 PM - +234 816 484 7452: As in

E no believe in us
5/7/22, 10:10 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂

I believe oo... I just don't believe in Management in Nigeria.
5/7/22, 10:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: He doesn’t know that it is because the knowledge and skill is scarce or rather business haven”t really thought of exploring that area properly
5/7/22, 10:10 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Who am I? Wetin I sabi 😅
5/7/22, 10:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It’s like now in the Data space . 

Everybody is either implementing a Data warehouse or a Data Lake here in Nigeria
5/7/22, 10:11 PM - +234 703 954 3297: Thanks
5/7/22, 10:11 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly my point.

If Businesses realised the potential of Knowledge Graphs, people would have been learning it.
5/7/22, 10:11 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But Lakehouse Implementation is scare out here in Nigeria because we have this mentality that you need the Databricks environment to get it right
5/7/22, 10:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: @2348164847452, I remember talking to Sir Eddie that I wanted to pick up Graph Database when I first heard of it while doing ABDA.

But no motivation, naso I drop am.
5/7/22, 10:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🤔
5/7/22, 10:12 PM - +234 817 743 5954: It's an honor to be amongst bosses🙌🏿🙇🏿‍♂️
5/7/22, 10:13 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Businesses see the use of dbt and MDS, that's why we have Analytics Engineering here.
5/7/22, 10:13 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Some top officials in some foreign companies have turned to it sef for personal project and they are ready to pay big for it if you can work for them on it

So na MSC and PhD students go gain if they find themselves in that environment
5/7/22, 10:14 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Because no one is doing it here
5/7/22, 10:14 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
But that’s because of the special publicity and evangelism @2348108522573 did oo
5/7/22, 10:15 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Even some companies see DE as basically SSIS, Talend and Informatica. 

It’s recently that a few cloud tools started coming up like ADF etc.
5/7/22, 10:16 PM - +234 708 145 1890: ADF 😍

Na @2347060577846 make me like Microsoft ehn.

5/7/22, 10:17 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I would just say it’s okay for every Data team to have their own R&D faction

It would really help them a lot
5/7/22, 10:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: @2348108522573  AE started as R&D 
There was a big problem, countless nights of research
5/7/22, 10:18 PM - +234 703 952 6987: <Media omitted>
5/7/22, 10:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s of recent bro o. 

By this time last year nothing like AE or dbt or MDS in this space o atleast to the best of my knowledge I may be wrong. 


It basically stem up from a major issue we had here. Many DS or DA folks joining a company and end of doing Data engineering or infrastructure work cos data not available. 

My diving into AE was a need I probably wouldn’t have if there was an infrastructure available and I start building the ML model I was recruited for to do 😂. 

I end up building infrastructure. My discovering AE was research actually when I was at that cross road of deliver value or lose your job 😂
5/7/22, 10:20 PM - +234 708 145 1890: My Boss and I were still talking about it.

How many companies even have R&D, not to talk of Data R & D.
5/7/22, 10:21 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 👌🏾

Beautiful...
5/7/22, 10:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It’s research actually

You want to have a good Data team. Have problems that put them to research
5/7/22, 10:21 PM - +234 703 954 3297: ☝️
5/7/22, 10:22 PM - +234 816 484 7452: This is still the fastest way and most successful way of picking up skills 🤣😂

Power Platform Boss. Welcome.
5/7/22, 10:28 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Many medium to large companies in Nigeria are Microsoft dominated and still use onprem tools like SSIS. This will likely shift over the next 2 to 3 years as companies migrate to cloud and adopt a hybrid approach and later fully cloud approach. The story for startups and newer business es is different. They can go fully cloud from day 1
5/7/22, 10:29 PM - +234 708 145 1890: IKR... It's totally cheaper for them.

Microsoft is doing great never the less. And they aren't backing down, they are ready for when Businesses decide to go cloud.
5/7/22, 10:29 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Making it easy to integrate what you already have with Cloud.
5/7/22, 10:29 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Even with LowCode/NoCode.
5/7/22, 10:31 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah exactly,
I also have to preach the Microsoft Gospel 😅 but we could replace SSIS workflows with better optimized open source pipelines that would do better.
5/7/22, 10:31 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Microsoft will win the medium to large organisstions cloud market in Nigeria. It is easy for them to transition to cloud that way. However, doubt they will win the start up and newer business market here. It will likely be an AWS, GCP play.
5/7/22, 10:32 PM - +234 816 484 7452: We would preach the Gospel of Building Lakehouses with Azure Databricks Environment
5/7/22, 10:32 PM - +234 816 484 7452: To the startup Guys
5/7/22, 10:32 PM - +234 708 145 1890: You can count the number of companies that would agree to use Open Source.

Definitely not banks (which are one of the largest data store houses in Nigeria).
5/7/22, 10:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Lol 😂🤣
That’s why there are paid and optimized versions of the Open source tools for them
5/7/22, 10:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Dbt is open source but there is the DBT cloud
5/7/22, 10:33 PM - +234 818 047 2075: <Media omitted>
5/7/22, 10:33 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😅

Preach it sir. 🙌🏾
I kuku have experience of drawing architectural diagrams and pitching to management.
5/7/22, 10:34 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I created this some months back to summarize the ecosystem. Because data professionals need to consider this during their learning journey
5/7/22, 10:34 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Honestly, Boss Ayodele did great with this diagram.

Much respect.
5/7/22, 10:34 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Delta Lake and Apache Spark are open source but there is the Azure Databricks Runtime environment with 10x optimized Spark versions for implementing your Lakehouses
5/7/22, 10:34 PM - +234 802 755 7589: @2348108522573, I see business opportunities; should they be ready. 

Whenever they are set to move from on-prem to cloud infrastructure, we can help with globally accepted best practices with the setup, refactoring, and training. 

We've got capable hands here.
5/7/22, 10:34 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Temilola is ready for this fight 🙌🏾
5/7/22, 10:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s not that easy actually as @2348180472075 said. 

I think we had this conversation too last month. Regulation and a whole lot of stuff limit companies from adopting cloud even though it’s better and way better but like boss @2348180472075  with time they will come to see that they can’t run from it.
5/7/22, 10:35 PM - +234 802 755 7589: I no see AE oh🤔
5/7/22, 10:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah this makes sense but I don’t see tools or technology like Airflow or RPA technology in any of the bucket

I guess we can just put them all under python
5/7/22, 10:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The tool stack are there. 

More around skills to learn to target startup and international companies based on your learning goals.
5/7/22, 10:36 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Data Consultancy.
5/7/22, 10:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: AE na recognized career ??🤣😂@2348027557589

5/7/22, 10:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Really Airflow and other workflow orchestration may not be mainstream yet for anyone to focus and learn
5/7/22, 10:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂
5/7/22, 10:37 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes there was no space. Plus I wanted to cover AE as a standalone. So people don't get confused.
5/7/22, 10:38 PM - +234 802 755 7589: I'm at peace now
5/7/22, 10:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Is this Ayodele Oluleye?

5/7/22, 10:42 PM - +234 802 755 7589: Shouldn't knime be a tool for data scientists? Or in your context, who are citizen analysts?
5/7/22, 10:42 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I just realised myself.
5/7/22, 10:42 PM - +234 816 484 7452: DE and DA needs Spark too. But this depends on the companies environment 

And you didn’t add Airbnb Apache Superset which is a major BI tool like metabase and the powerbi out there with even more complexities
5/7/22, 10:42 PM - +234 708 145 1890: People that don't type code.

Knime is no-code
5/7/22, 10:44 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Make I go look am again.

5/7/22, 10:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Now they are talking about Unbundling BI with MDS which Dagster is trying to achieve
5/7/22, 10:50 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Low code analysts or data scientists.  Typically business users who are tech savvy but not too technical
5/7/22, 10:51 PM - +234 708 531 6273: I have never seen this in a JD before. Will start looking out for it.
5/7/22, 10:51 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Dagstar is Airflow rivalry. 

Prophet and Luigi we don’t even hear of them again.
5/7/22, 10:51 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Will appreciate your feedback. Thanks
5/7/22, 10:51 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The idea is if you can use Airflow definitely you can use it.
5/7/22, 10:51 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Retweet.

Airflow or "natin"
5/7/22, 10:51 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Citizen analyst - anyone who does analytics heavily without being in an actual analytics role. Mostly business folks or managers.

Citizen data scientist - same as above, but focus on data science, decision optimization, etc.

In both cases, they use no-code/low-code platforms
5/7/22, 10:52 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Exactly this captures it perfectly 👌👌
5/7/22, 10:52 PM - +234 816 484 7452: God I am having goosebumps @2348108522573 

I am excited here
5/7/22, 10:52 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I feel like for someone to be a Citizen analyst or scientist, they probably got tired of writing code.

KNIME is beautiful if you ask me
5/7/22, 10:54 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Like our Azure Product users 🤗
5/7/22, 10:54 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Tosin on LinkedIn is a heavy Knime advocate
5/7/22, 10:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I think the target for people like this is managerial levels. 

For me now, I would love to manage Data Products.

I understand the code, I can do my analysis.
5/7/22, 10:55 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I see you
5/7/22, 10:56 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Lol, there are also cases of those who just want to get their hands dirty with data, leveraging their business domain expertise, but either don't have the luxury of time to learn coding or are just plain not interested.
5/7/22, 10:56 PM - +234 802 755 7589: I remember back then, even when they say no open source we still dey use knime.
5/7/22, 10:56 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
All these companies have their open source version and the paid version

It’s purely business
5/7/22, 10:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Open source SSIS includes 

Apache NIFI
Apache Hop 

Those two were built to rival SSIS
5/7/22, 10:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Following her.

She was the one that made me know L1 KNIME certification is now free.
5/7/22, 10:58 PM - +234 905 939 2803: 😭😭
5/7/22, 10:58 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Another business model
5/7/22, 10:58 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Airflow nko
5/7/22, 10:59 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Airflow involves the code
5/7/22, 10:59 PM - +234 816 484 7452: These other guys have little code too but just the conventional drag and drop
5/7/22, 10:59 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I read you loud and clear boss.

Besides, Azure ML is low code self.
5/7/22, 10:59 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Nice... I should check them out!
5/7/22, 11:00 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Be like say I go be No-code/Low code advocate now 😅
5/7/22, 11:00 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 👌🏾
5/7/22, 11:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But on a low, I think it would make sense one day to blow your stakeholders away and present your data visualization in terms of Knowledge Graph than Power Bi and Tableau
5/7/22, 11:01 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Alteryx isn't popular in Nigeria except you did ML with Udacity 😂
5/7/22, 11:01 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🌚

With the way you are talking about this, I am actually interested.
5/7/22, 11:02 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Blow their minds away
5/7/22, 11:03 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Woo... @2348164847452, no con finish my head for here 😂

5/7/22, 11:03 PM - +234 708 531 6273: The thing is that all those tools can and will still need to be extended with code. There is a limit to what the UI can offer. So many edge cases to deal with.
Faced similar thing with Nifi but I couldn't write Java. I had to dribble my boss till I left 😅

5/7/22, 11:09 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Don't mind them. And My boss was like it is plug and and play. Until we contacted Customer Care and they told us we will have to refactor the generic demand forecasting code to our business need.

How lowcode person go fit refactor code? 😂😂
5/7/22, 11:09 PM - +234 904 894 6475: When going for no or low-code platforms, your winning strategy is to ensure you have deep understanding of the business of data, to ensure your analytics workflows efficiently align with business operations and expectations. 

Otherwise, there's no selling point because a data analyst or scientist already has the advantage of technical ability like coding, stats, machine learning, etc.

In terms of tools and platforms, the low code/no-code tools in @2348180472075's diagram are suitable for citizen analysts. For citizen data scientists, add Alteryx, DataRobot, Google AutoML, AzureML
5/7/22, 11:10 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly
5/7/22, 11:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Customer support engrs would handle it for you
5/7/22, 11:11 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌
5/7/22, 11:12 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Those indians? All he did was to point us to where the existing code resides.  It was a really painful experience.
5/7/22, 11:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 💯 

I am enjoying this. 

Thanks boss
5/7/22, 11:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And Citizen Analysts will be the major population in any organization really
5/7/22, 11:13 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly... For me now.

I spend days sitting with Business & Process Owners understanding & documenting their requirements as a Business Analyst.

I don't want to spend so much time getting some preliminary work done.
5/7/22, 11:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ouch... Sorry about that.
5/7/22, 11:14 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
But he was of help
5/7/22, 11:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: A big mistake will be thinking No-code/Low-code can replace coding.
5/7/22, 11:14 PM - +234 708 531 6273: <Media omitted>
5/7/22, 11:15 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Thanks jare.
5/7/22, 11:15 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes, there's a limit to the flexibility you get with those platforms. When you want to optimise, improve or scale the solution, you now need to turn to code. 

IMO, DataRobot is the most advanced no-code platform right now for ML use cases because it's the best one so far that gives you further ability to tweak results without having to extend with code.
5/7/22, 11:16 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Every business person can be potentially a Citizen Analyst, if they understood the workflow behind it.

It's easy for me to design a DS workflow on KNIME or create a Power App, because I understand know and spent some time writing codes.
5/7/22, 11:17 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohh... Nice! Haven't played with DataRobot before.

I guess KNIME already got me hooked, I wasn't too impressed with Alteryx so I didn't bother exploring again.
5/7/22, 11:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Please try out Azure ML studio
5/7/22, 11:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You can tweak things too
5/7/22, 11:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You can even publish your models as workbooks for others to consume

5/7/22, 11:19 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But that’s why there’s a different service for this @2347085316273
5/7/22, 11:20 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, this was my first. Plus I have a MS AI certification.

Had to use Azure ML for some AI workflows. It was sweet.

But KNIME is Open Source 😍.
5/7/22, 11:20 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Lmao
5/7/22, 11:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Knime is not open source oo
5/7/22, 11:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Just say you use open source knife
5/7/22, 11:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Knime
5/7/22, 11:21 PM - +234 708 531 6273: As at 2019 when I interfaced with it, that was my reality. Can't say about now sha
5/7/22, 11:22 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ehn...en? I really thought it was.

Developed by some scientists in Switzerland and all of that.

5/7/22, 11:24 PM - +234 708 145 1890: You can build KNIME components/connectors if you want.
5/7/22, 11:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: It is open source but if you need to do enterprise grade stuff, then you need Knime server hosted on AWS or Azure. Usually about USD30k and above
5/7/22, 11:25 PM - +234 818 047 2075: *and deploy models in production
5/7/22, 11:25 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... Thank you boss for clearing me on that.
5/7/22, 11:26 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly. The main purpose of no or low-code is to achieve fast iterations of an idea or to get a prototype up and running fast. So as business folks in orgs become more and more data literate, they can use these tools to test their ideas, get initial viable solutions, etc, before assigning or approving projects for technical teams.

In this kind of environment, the value a data scientist will bring in is to extend those ideas with code, use statistics to make reasonable assumptions, and build robust solutions that can be justified with interpretability best practices.
5/7/22, 11:27 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌👌
5/7/22, 11:28 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Well said boss!

5/8/22, 8:13 AM - +234 810 612 9023: I think it was because of the research you did around Agriculture or so
5/8/22, 8:15 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Hello friends.

Please does anyone here have first hand information about Unicaf?
5/8/22, 8:15 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I mean how real it is.
5/8/22, 8:19 AM - +234 810 612 9023: A friend got a partial scholarship through it
5/8/22, 8:20 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Yes, they have partial scholarships and the cost is relatively okay compared to platforms like edX and Coursera.
5/8/22, 8:21 AM - +234 903 783 8682: How long has your friend spent on the program.
5/8/22, 8:21 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Perhaps he can share his experience.
5/8/22, 8:21 AM - +234 903 783 8682: It's difficult to find first hand information about Unicaf even on Nairaland.
5/8/22, 8:22 AM - +234 810 612 9023: He started last year November or so
5/8/22, 8:22 AM - +234 810 612 9023: He’s not here

🌚🤲🏾

I believe greats bosses do this tho.
5/8/22, 10:18 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Lol 😂🤣

They only check if tables have dropped or not. No one inspects DE code whether he has cooked beans or not.
5/8/22, 10:22 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Yeah it's real.

You may choose to study with a partner University or unicaf university itself.

But tutorials is actually handled by unicaf, not the partner uni. They also supply the study material.


Another option is to use Stafford Global (Google it).

Edx has a few schools offering scholarships for MSc too now.
5/8/22, 10:22 AM - +234 816 484 7452: At where I was before, apart from unit tests passing with linter, pre-commit , flake8 and black passing too , if your code coverage doesn’t hit at least 80% , you are joking with your salary .
5/8/22, 10:23 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I'll check edX. I didn't know any of their schools offer msc scholarship.
5/8/22, 10:23 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I got an email. It's new
5/8/22, 10:23 AM - +234 703 806 5681: <Media omitted>
5/8/22, 10:23 AM - +234 703 806 5681: That's the mail
5/8/22, 10:31 AM - +234 903 783 8682: That analytics course looks like the best fit for a data professional
5/8/22, 10:37 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Take a shot at it then. AU tends to be expensive though, so you'll need to find the full price.

But there's another school that has an Analytics Masters for USD 10k on Edx too.
5/8/22, 10:42 AM - +234 903 783 8682: USD10k is a lot of money, at least for me.

Unicaf courses are GPD3k if you're paying in installments. And even lesser if you're paying once.

Also, these edX universities usually require TOEFL, Gre and all sorts of English tests.

But I think Unicaf will only request for your WAEC English and maybe any English electives you did in undergrad.
5/8/22, 10:53 AM - +234 909 130 5248: We do this in my own company
5/8/22, 10:53 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Edx don't all require GRE though.

Like I said the major difference between both is that with Edx universities, the institutions are whom you'll directly interface with. Lessons from them. Study materials from them etc.

With unicaf, the partner institution is really just a partner. They'll share their syllabus, but unicaf handles the lessons, learning materials etc.
The Partner uni just gives you a certificate after everything.
5/8/22, 10:56 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Difference will be in the quality of the Learning.

But if certificate is your major interest, then unicaf is aite.
5/8/22, 12:15 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Chief Long time. Nice to meet you here again. 💪
5/8/22, 12:15 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Oh it was the research/writeup I did for DSN's AI use cases playbook. I think you were working on a similar project and I shared the resources I had with you.
5/8/22, 12:15 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 🙏
5/8/22, 12:18 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Yes, yes, I was! Thanks, they were helpful at the time. 😊
5/8/22, 12:18 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This is why data quality checks and data observability are now critical and getting more attention these days. Business users shouldn't be telling me numbers are wrong before I know that my pipelines have beans
5/8/22, 12:19 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Speaking of this btw, do you have a tool you use for data quality checks? Asides from, say, Great Expectations?
5/8/22, 12:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Pipelines get beans 😂😂😂
5/8/22, 12:19 PM - +234 810 612 9023: It's something I've been looking into lately
5/8/22, 12:20 PM - +234 818 047 2075: The best approach is to get quality and observability systems that make the team more proactive but they are expensive >20k.
5/8/22, 12:20 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Especially around comparing source and destination systems
5/8/22, 12:20 PM - +234 810 612 9023: At least one that isn't built on dbt. Most of them seem to be these days
5/8/22, 12:20 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Plan to get a data catalog with these capabilities hopefully this year. But those things are expensive for most Nigerian companies
5/8/22, 12:20 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I think I can fetch a couple of tools you can look at but I would have to check my archive
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Great expectations is a good one but you will just have to do a lot of ground work
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Great expectation 

And you can explore Data Catalogue & Observatility like Monte carlo
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Atlan and Great expectations are good one to check out
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Yeah Monte carlo, Soda, Atlan, Alation, Ovaledge
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But the tools o mostly know are open source
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: ✅✅✅
5/8/22, 12:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: There are quite a number but they are expensive for a number of companies
5/8/22, 12:22 PM - +234 810 612 9023: I tried to integrate Great Expectations in our Airflow Workflow, but it's currently unsatisfactory for our use case
5/8/22, 12:22 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Yeah, pricing can be quite an issue actually
5/8/22, 12:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What’s your use case??
5/8/22, 12:23 PM - +234 810 612 9023: I was on a call with Bigeye a few weeks back, great product, but pricing is a bit high
5/8/22, 12:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: We built business rules in python it gave more flexibility. We have integrated output with PowerBi to monitor critical fields. But that is our temporary solution till we get a proper tool
5/8/22, 12:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: What we have done just addresses quality not observibility
5/8/22, 12:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Pricing is actually crazy with lot of service products
5/8/22, 12:25 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Been in talks with Ovaledge. They are the cheapest I have seen and even that it is >15k
5/8/22, 12:26 PM - +234 810 612 9023: So we need to validate destination systems against source systems. Great expectations seem to validate against the metrics you specify just on the data itself. Also doesn't give as much observability, except maybe  causing the pipelines to fail when used with Airflow
5/8/22, 12:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What one of our client did is to integrate dbt/Great expectation to monitor and track pipeline state embedded with Airflow.
5/8/22, 12:27 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I think I found it 
Open source tools for Data Quality and Observabiliry
5/8/22, 12:27 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think great expectations addresses data quality not sure it does observibility

@2347033167142 just in time for you to have other options apart from GE
5/8/22, 12:27 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Hmmmm...I'm looking for a solution that wouldn't involve us writing a significant amount of code for i.e. easy adoption.
5/8/22, 12:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah 

They layered dbt logs with Datafold
5/8/22, 12:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Datafold is also a great tool.
5/8/22, 12:29 PM - +234 818 047 2075: For us it is temporary till we get a tool. It was an urgent project, so we had to do something. You can check ovaledge out. See if it meets your needs
5/8/22, 12:29 PM - +234 810 612 9023: dbt is quite central to most open-source data quality and observability tools this days.
5/8/22, 12:30 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Ok, I'll check it out. Thanks
5/8/22, 12:30 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I personally believe that , what you would use for data quality and observability depends largely on your environment and team stack right now
5/8/22, 12:31 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks for this 🙏
5/8/22, 12:32 PM - +234 816 484 7452: On our end for data quality checks, we use out of the box delta lake logs  and lakeFS CI/CD hooks for approval for the data that goes from DEV environment to PRD
5/8/22, 12:33 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Thing is, we haven't adopted dbt in our Airflow workflow yet. Matter of fact, we just got started with Airflow in February, and only have just the initial set of jobs up.
5/8/22, 12:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: If you don’t want to a lot of coding to implement these things, you just have to pay for premium environnement where you can just call these things
5/8/22, 12:33 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Thanks for this
5/8/22, 12:38 PM - +234 818 415 3106: For like 48hours, i have been reading everything and i can boldly beat my chest that i no understand shingbin or relate but in all😭

5/8/22, 12:43 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The fact that you actually consistently read through shows you are passionate about data in general, and it just takes learning and consistency, you will soon start contributing to such conversations.
5/8/22, 12:43 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
5/8/22, 12:44 PM - +234 818 415 3106: Guy woke up at around 3am and checked the group never knew when i sighed and said Na wa o

5/8/22, 12:45 PM - +234 818 415 3106: So you all are looking for an amplifier
5/8/22, 12:45 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s really going to be in high demand soon cos a lot of pipelines are chaotic. 

Hence why a school of thoughts believe meta data should be driving Data infrastructure and pipeline to make it easy to fix any pipeline that breaks because proper data governance and definition have been done. So it will be easy to know where to look it any numbers doesn’t add up

5/8/22, 12:49 PM - +234 706 936 1298: It’s already in high demand
5/8/22, 12:49 PM - +234 818 415 3106: All i know is sooner or later i would come back and say so these are all what this guys were saying
5/8/22, 12:49 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The demand don high already but people are quiet about it because the folks who can deliver are few

And a bunch of people out there can only use vendor specific tools
5/8/22, 12:50 PM - +234 708 674 2097: And me too oo.
5/8/22, 12:50 PM - +234 818 415 3106: *these

5/8/22, 1:09 PM - +234 703 954 3297: Same here
All I know I'm blessed to be in a group with a lot of great people who have so much knowledge about Data.

I feel inspired
5/8/22, 1:11 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I just want to chip in something.

Data management is not meant for beginners. Not because it's unimportant but because there are more pressing topics to cover.
5/8/22, 1:14 PM - +234 817 925 1327: 👍🏾
5/8/22, 1:24 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Same here bro, @2348164847452 is patiently waiting for our disturbance(s)
5/8/22, 1:28 PM - +234 810 686 4060: Hmmm

Mind sharing some of those topics, Boss?? 😀😀

Lemme be jotting finngs down

5/8/22, 1:31 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌
5/8/22, 1:43 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Lol. 

I'm just an enthusiast like you.

The topics you'll need to cover depend on the track you wish to take.
5/8/22, 1:43 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Typical tracks are data analyst, data scientist and data engineer.
5/8/22, 1:46 PM - +234 703 954 3297: So after gaining experience from these tracks, we can move to the ones you were discussing
5/8/22, 1:47 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🤲🏾

5/8/22, 1:53 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌

I will advise that one starts with ML or BI in the early days and then over time pick up some data management knowledge. There is currently no path (that i am aware of) that allows people start off with data management. For example, I started learning about data management around this time last year while interviewing for my current role. Prior to that time it was mostly ML and BI
5/8/22, 1:57 PM - +234 703 954 3297: Thanks for the info
5/8/22, 1:59 PM - +234 816 484 7452: True and very correct bu there will be exceptions for DE guys to know at least something on Data Management and Governance at the very least.
5/8/22, 2:03 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌
5/8/22, 2:18 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Sounds reasonable.

It's a fundamental aspect of their role.
5/8/22, 2:18 PM - +234 903 783 8682: By the way DE means Data Engineer.
5/8/22, 2:26 PM - +234 909 880 8992: Who has scale through Toptal screening here before

5/8/22, 5:21 PM - +234 903 783 8682: You can go to jovian.ai/learn and take the courses one after the other.

Start from the zero to Python.

Then data analysis zero to pandas.

Then Machine Learning.

Then Data Structures and algorithms.

Then, deep learning.

Finally, you can take the career readiness test.

5/8/22, 11:14 PM - +234 708 531 6273: <Media omitted>

5/8/22, 11:16 PM - +234 810 831 6393: God bless you abundantly boss 🙏 🙇‍♂️
5/8/22, 11:17 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Did this before coming here boss 🥲
5/8/22, 11:17 PM - +234 816 009 5896: Hey guys, what's up?
Out of curiosity, (more like a necessity for me)
Is it possible to get an accountability partner here?
5/8/22, 11:17 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Not available for free download
5/8/22, 11:17 PM - +234 810 878 6913: For?
5/8/22, 11:18 PM - +234 708 531 6273: You welcome. Though I don't think you will learn any "Data Engineering on AWS" from the book. 

It is just like an overview of AWS services. I haven't seen 1 book that gives you what you need for data engineering on AWS.
5/8/22, 11:18 PM - +234 909 880 8992: This platform is already looking like stackoverflow for data guys. Anything you ask you go get answer
5/8/22, 11:19 PM - +234 816 009 5896: Data science as a whole.
5/8/22, 11:20 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 🥺, it's one of the books mentioned in a medium link shared by @2348164847452 sometimes last week. Got two out of the books already
5/8/22, 11:20 PM - +234 810 878 6913: So what do you advise?
5/8/22, 11:21 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. That's cool
5/8/22, 11:21 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Next question I will was going to ask
5/8/22, 11:22 PM - +234 810 831 6393: *~will~*
5/8/22, 11:28 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. *Sometimes*, those just are just looking for who will buy through their link. Affiliate marketing stuff. The book is good for intro to the services.
5/8/22, 11:31 PM - +234 708 531 6273: First thing is to understand is which area of DE are you looking into? Streaming or Data warehousing?
5/8/22, 11:34 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 🥺😭😭
5/8/22, 11:35 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Which would you recommend for a newbie?
5/8/22, 11:35 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I meant someone who's just looking at transitioning into DE
5/8/22, 11:42 PM - +234 708 531 6273: For streaming

You have to focus more on the kinesis family, SQS, SNS, Lambda, VPC, S3 , and Cloud watch... You will have to find resources that treat each of them thoroughly, especially those that use Python Boto3 to interact with the services.

For Data warehousing and Data lake, your focus will be on
Redshift, Athena, S3 and maybe glue.


No matter which one you choose, you will also learn how to deploy them with Terraform, dockerize some of the services, write python, SQL and Spark.

No book really joins these pieces together. You have to merge things here and there. If your focus is streaming - though I hardly see 9ja DEs work on projects in this area - I can help point to some resources.
5/8/22, 11:45 PM - +234 810 831 6393: @2347085316273???
5/8/22, 11:46 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Which one u wan focus?
5/8/22, 11:46 PM - +234 810 831 6393: You may please shed more light on which aspect you think someone who's just starting off should look into
5/8/22, 11:46 PM - +234 810 831 6393: What's the difference between the two?
5/8/22, 11:47 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I have some exposure to Terraform & Docker already 🤔
5/8/22, 11:51 PM - +234 708 531 6273: It is tricky. What you will end up doing depends on the company you later find yourself. 
If I want to advise someone looking into the Nigeria market, I will say data lake/warehousing and migration path.

Redshift, Athena, glue , dbt, Airflow. If you have any Open Source ETL tool then you can ignore glue.
5/8/22, 11:51 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 🤔
5/8/22, 11:52 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤔
5/8/22, 11:52 PM - +234 810 831 6393: How about someone looking at global opportunities?
5/8/22, 11:52 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Streaming?
5/8/22, 11:53 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Streaming has to do with real-time data (usually in kb per millisecs) while Data warehousing and stuff deal with batch data.
5/8/22, 11:54 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Now I get it better. I thought there was another meaning to the terminologies other than the ones I already knew.
5/8/22, 11:55 PM - +234 708 531 6273: The two.

Companies have different use cases. So they will approach you with knowledge of the two.

5/8/22, 11:55 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 🤔
5/8/22, 11:56 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So one can get started with batch and then upskill to streaming?
5/8/22, 11:57 PM - +234 810 831 6393: What resources or learning path/roadmap would you recommend for batch?

5/8/22, 11:58 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Google owns pub-sub I think 🤔?
5/8/22, 11:59 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So what cloud provider would you recommend for a starter? I currently have access to active subscriptions to both AWS and Azure
5/8/22, 11:59 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Pub-sub is a concept associated with messaging systems. Publishers and subscribers. I.e the sender and receiver.
5/9/22, 12:00 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Which would you recommend that I stick to for a start?
5/9/22, 12:00 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Oh okay, I knew of *Google Cloud pub-sub*

5/9/22, 12:04 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Thanks for this 👆, Snowflakes chop my eyes last year while I was experimenting with dbt
5/9/22, 12:05 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I think I'll want to stick with AWS for now, do you think it's a good/wise decision?
5/9/22, 12:06 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Trial lapsed, and I couldn't access my resources again 😭🥲
5/9/22, 12:06 AM - +234 708 531 6273: To add an extra layer of complexity, let your python script and Airflow instance be containerized and pushed to AWS ECS.
5/9/22, 12:07 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Boss please adopt me as one of your mentees 🥺🙏
5/9/22, 12:08 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Not bad. Some recruiters won't reject you if you are just good with 1 cloud provider. The knowledge is transferrable.
5/9/22, 12:08 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Permit me to slide into your DM (in advance) as I set out on this journey
5/9/22, 12:10 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. I am still learning too o. I am just opportune to see where it is being done. I am far from being an expert. 😅
5/9/22, 12:11 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I have some exposure to GCP, Azure, AWS and IBM Watson (a little bit of Alibaba cloud)

5/9/22, 12:13 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Please be ready to serve as a *compass* to me (and other folks) as I (we) navigate through this new adventure 🙏
5/9/22, 12:13 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Good. Nothing will sound strange to you again.
5/9/22, 12:14 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I should think/guess so
5/9/22, 12:15 AM - +234 809 183 1446: 👍🏽
5/9/22, 12:15 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Not a problem.


For anyone interested in streaming, he or she should start by inserting data into Kinesis and using lambda to poll the data.
5/9/22, 12:15 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I'm lost here ooo
5/9/22, 12:15 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Novice like me
5/9/22, 12:16 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Noted, when I get here, I'm sure I'm in safe hands here with bosses like you et others
5/9/22, 12:16 AM - +234 813 028 5102: RT
5/9/22, 12:18 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. In the process of doing what I said up you will understand a lot of things. 

I am sure you will start by typing "what is kinesis" on google or you tube and that will usher you into the lake of knowledge 😅
5/9/22, 12:22 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Boss can I be your mentee?
5/9/22, 12:25 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. Feel free to connect. I can be very busy sha o so no vex if I no reply on time 😒. I am not a bad person

5/9/22, 12:42 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. Make I join you na
5/9/22, 12:43 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Nope.
5/9/22, 12:44 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Then I'm cool
5/9/22, 12:44 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Well, you need to think of it this way, people are busy with work and their personal life, they sometimes completely forget that you dropped off a line for them. Gentle and warm reminders are not bad. Just ensure you are not constituting a nuisance to them
5/9/22, 12:46 AM - +234 810 878 6913: True, I understand. But I'm talking of the case, of a series of reminders without a response.
5/9/22, 12:46 AM - +234 810 831 6393: If you drop them a line, you can politely call their attention to it here. They'll know that you tagged them in a comment, and it'll (might) help them navigate to your message easily
5/9/22, 12:46 AM - +234 810 878 6913: For a day
5/9/22, 12:46 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Personally, I clear my chat everyday at night
5/9/22, 12:47 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I'm still online to clear my chat
5/9/22, 12:47 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I don't like seeing unread messages
5/9/22, 12:48 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Sometimes I'm guilty of this, it might take a couple of days to respond to your message. Cos on some days, life might decide to be frustrating
5/9/22, 12:49 AM - +234 810 878 6913: 🤣🤣 work stress
5/9/22, 12:50 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Yesterday, my CEO dropped off a message for my colleague and I on the DS channel, none of us replied (intentionally), bàbà called while I was in a session, I couldn't answer his call, I only got to call him later
5/9/22, 12:51 AM - +234 810 831 6393: He mentioned the message he dropped on the channel told him politely to wait until today, we'll thrash it out on a joint call
5/9/22, 12:55 AM - +234 708 531 6273: 👏 you have said it all.
5/9/22, 12:57 AM - +234 708 531 6273: I am in so many groups,  so messages get lost in between. WhatsApp needs to provide folder system

5/9/22, 10:57 AM - +234 818 047 2075: 2016/2017 was when it started but it had just few people. DSN started kate 2017 and helped to drive awareness. AI saturadays too. So there are few people that have 5 years.
5/9/22, 10:57 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Welcone to the confusion

5/9/22, 10:58 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Sometimes this doesn't matter especially in the Nigeria setting. If you have good experience some companies will take you. I had 3 to 4 years less experience for my current role and I still got it

5/9/22, 11:08 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Have you guys seen why I said, I don’t get the logic when people say they have 17 years core data experience
5/9/22, 11:08 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Or 10 years 😅
5/9/22, 11:09 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I sha know that it is 2017 - 2018 we started 

Na why I Dey always talk sey anybody with 17 years experience ehn suppose be Chief Data Scientist for a major conglomerate
5/9/22, 11:10 AM - S+N Ayoade: Sir 🤲🏻
5/9/22, 11:12 AM - +234 818 047 2075: The only people that can have up to 10 years, are people who started with a Bank's MIS team (mostly BI work) or Bluechip, a niche consulting company (mostly data warehousing).
5/9/22, 11:12 AM - +234 818 047 2075: *In Nigeria

5/9/22, 11:14 AM - +234 816 484 7452: To be frank they were all Excel data analyst or SPSS, matlab and Stata specialist.  Except for the core guys running Things on Finacle Core in Banks using Oracle those days.
5/9/22, 11:17 AM - +234 816 484 7452: On a lighter note, i just feel putting it out there that you have 10  or 17 years experience makes me want to expect too much from you.

Be giving me cold chills that I was still in secondary school or primary school when some people were doing data 🤣😂
5/9/22, 11:18 AM - +234 816 484 7452: At those age that I didn’t even know what I would do with my life 🤣😂

Me thinking I would still be a doctor or Pilot 🤣😂
5/9/22, 11:27 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes Telcos too. Exactly the finacle and flexcube guys in banks.
5/9/22, 11:28 AM - +234 818 047 2075: It is ridiculous to be honest. I think anything higher than 5 at the moment won't fly. It would be hard to get the talent.
5/9/22, 11:29 AM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤣🤣🤣
5/9/22, 11:30 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Makes me remember those primary school songs🤣

5/9/22, 2:36 PM - Abraham Musa: I found the ish now. I had to leverage the init_notebook_mode in plotly offline module but also *trust the html output*. Never knew you have to toggle that option in jupytelab. 😪

5/9/22, 2:41 PM - S+N Ayoade: Yes
5/9/22, 2:41 PM - S+N Ayoade: Check DM sir
5/9/22, 2:42 PM - +234 703 316 7142: But we have capable hands here that can take the assignment, bosses like @2348183685814. I doubt they will collect that 25K, they even want Havard standard referencing and they will still use turnitin🤣
5/9/22, 2:43 PM - S+N Ayoade: I don pass am 😂 

If $ dey the 25k now, I for submit CV

He just sent me money 🥹
5/9/22, 3:16 PM - +234 802 755 7589: It has Nigeria on it. 

Anything Nigeria gonna have to be after next year’s election
5/9/22, 3:16 PM - +234 818 415 3106: @2348027557589 how far
5/9/22, 3:16 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Let me run for my life with this statement 🤣😂
5/9/22, 3:16 PM - +234 802 755 7589: Not this government try to keep you poor
5/9/22, 3:17 PM - +234 802 755 7589: @2347038065681 can give better advice
5/9/22, 3:17 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But if you notice, @2348027557589 has been consistent with this investment opportunity thing

E dey find where to dump money
5/9/22, 3:17 PM - +234 816 484 7452: @2347038065681 can bear me witness 😂🤣
5/9/22, 3:18 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Nah. This won't be affected.
5/9/22, 3:19 PM - +234 703 806 5681: FG treasuries and bonds are one of the safest investments out there.
5/9/22, 3:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Coupons are paid upfront actually.

It's the issuing houses that pay it quarterly.
5/9/22, 3:20 PM - +234 703 316 7142: @2348027557589 🤲🏽
5/9/22, 3:24 PM - +234 903 905 0643: It's the confidence for me, as long as it based off the economy, it would be affected
5/9/22, 3:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I don't have energy to explain how Government bonds work and how their coupon rates are fixed and unchanged once its been placed.

But sure, do whatever you want.
5/9/22, 3:28 PM - +234 802 755 7589: @2347038065681 , I think there's usually a minimum buy - $5k I think.
5/9/22, 3:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: The minimum but here is 5k Naira.

This isn't Euro bonds.
5/9/22, 3:28 PM - +234 802 755 7589: Gotcha!!
5/9/22, 3:35 PM - +234 708 145 1890: But the currency devaluation after 2-3yrs (+ inflation) would make my interest like water.
5/9/22, 3:36 PM - +234 708 145 1890: If it was Eurobonds now. Na Dollar funds I dey eye like this.

🤲🏾
5/9/22, 3:37 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂
5/9/22, 3:37 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Choose your struggle.

Preserve capital and lower interest.

Or

Hope for capital appreciation and likely lose the capital in the process.
5/9/22, 3:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: A balanced portfolio accounts for everything in different percentages. Including keeping cash.
5/9/22, 3:38 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂

How about preserve capital with lower interest but in a different currency.
5/9/22, 3:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Imagine all your money was in stocks and Crypto now with this red candles everywhere
5/9/22, 3:38 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 👌🏾
5/9/22, 3:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Premium tears.

Well, there's ~hope~ hold for the future 😅.
5/9/22, 3:39 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You can do that.

But the interest on dollar mutual funds are typically lower (like 2.5% sometimes), with a longer holding period, and fewer payouts in between.
5/9/22, 3:41 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You can hold. But many Millennials and Gen Z got into stock and Crypto at the height of one of the greatest bull runs in history.

The economy moves in cycles.

We are likely heading towards a recession, like we had in 2008.

Your next major bull run may take another 5 - 10 years.

For Diamond hands, that isn't a long wait.

For paper hands and people who didn't diversify from the start, well... some premium tears waiting to happen.
5/9/22, 3:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... I think I see clearer now.

With this, I think I can hedge against currency devaluation.

If Naira drops further in 5yrs (stats show devaluation rate of about 13.58% per annum).

But like you said, the sweet spot is having a diversified portfolio.
5/9/22, 3:49 PM - S+N Ayoade: Soft Boy for President 🥰🥰🥰

Fire on boss 🔥🔥🔥
5/9/22, 3:51 PM - S+N Ayoade: How much would you advice plus when’s that service coming up !
5/9/22, 3:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I don't know how much you have lol.

There's a window there. Opens May 9. Closes May 18
5/9/22, 3:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I also don't know what your goals are so cash flow can be managed appropriately
5/9/22, 4:01 PM - +234 806 593 5396: @2347038065681 what is the issue with MF, the interest rate lately is smaller than peanuts?
5/9/22, 4:01 PM - S+N Ayoade: I just wanna get rich 😂
5/9/22, 4:01 PM - S+N Ayoade: With minimum injury 😂
5/9/22, 4:03 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Barest minimum injury? 

This is a good opportunity for you den
5/9/22, 4:07 PM - +234 903 783 8682: After 5 years, I don't think there's much difference between people as far as experience is concerned.
5/9/22, 4:12 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Most HRs I've seen categorize experience into 
No experience.
1 year experience
2-3 years experience
Less than 5years experience.
Over five years experience.

I've never seen 10years experience or 15years experience.

My point is, I don't see any reason why anyone with over 5years experience should be intimidated by 10 years, 17years experience.
5/9/22, 4:16 PM - S+N Ayoade: Have you checked industrial work JD 😂
5/9/22, 4:20 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I've not. Please tell me more.
5/9/22, 4:22 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's low risk. Rates will respond to the state of the economy.
5/9/22, 4:22 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Be like say you no de check UAE jobs out 😂😅
5/9/22, 4:23 PM - S+N Ayoade: 😂
5/9/22, 4:24 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Those guys ehn 🤧
5/9/22, 4:27 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You don’t get the gist

No one is intimidated, we are only saying that by default we expect so much from them and only to find out that they are not like the real deal as they claim to be 😅
5/9/22, 4:27 PM - +234 808 339 2756: It depends on the robustness of your 5 years of experience for you not to be scared of 17+ years of experience
5/9/22, 4:28 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Excel, SPSS, Minitab, Stata et al data experts be telling you they have 10+ years of experience 🥲🌚
5/9/22, 4:29 PM - +234 903 783 8682: True.
5/9/22, 4:30 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Why should you be scared when the top is empty and the sky is big enough to accommodate everyone

We see people at age 20 - 25 switching between the different FAANG companies like is child’s play.

So sometimes, especially in Nigeria, experience no Dey gel
5/9/22, 4:32 PM - +234 903 783 8682: In a way, those years of Excel and SPSS should also count.

At least they were working with data all those years. 

Tools change but the concepts persist.
5/9/22, 4:33 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Yeah kinda, but I think they don't need to bloat things. That's what we're saying
5/9/22, 4:34 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I've been using statistical packages since 2015 (as a Data Analyst), that doesn't mean that I have 7+ years of experience in DS
5/9/22, 4:34 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Seriously, 5 years experience in many Nigerian companies might not be as useful as a year internship in those big companies.

Moreover, after 17years of work I think you should be shifting to managerial position.
5/9/22, 4:34 PM - +234 810 831 6393: My DS journey only started in 2018 (more of training than work then self)
5/9/22, 4:34 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Very true.
5/9/22, 4:36 PM - +234 810 831 6393: It's better to be explicit about your niche. Say 17+ years SPSS expert, people won't drag you
5/9/22, 4:37 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Shey our professors in school no know SPSS and other packages? Thing is shey them fit do most of what we're doing now with advanced statistical tools (say program based tools)
5/9/22, 4:38 PM - +234 903 783 8682: True 

Because if they later find out it won't be funny.
5/9/22, 4:39 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Shifting to managerial should come from year 6-8. It is only >10 years in places like banks. 17 years is bogus. In my past life  (consulting), you become the equivalent of an MD from about 13 years if you are good
5/9/22, 4:42 PM - +234 810 831 6393: It's funny now
5/9/22, 4:44 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I once had an encounter with a supposed "senior software engineer" as he called himself. Bàbá claimed he had 9+ years of experience, but when we gave him a project to handle. We almost ran into a serious debt.
5/9/22, 4:45 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Funniest thing is that the dude even gave us quote, only for us to find out that bàbà is a scam 😂😅
5/9/22, 4:46 PM - +234 810 831 6393: He left core parts of the project, he was telling us that he only focused on "core functionalities" and didn't bother about "miscellaneous" 🥺

5/9/22, 5:39 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Don't even go there. One once told me that if we understood the project and can handle it, we would not bring it to him in the first instance 😂😅

5/9/22, 7:37 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Good evening everyone,

NLP/ Text Mining experts, does it make sense to build a classification model on classes generated from topic modelling? I don't know if I'm putting it right but here's what I mean.

1. You apply topic modelling on a large data of text
2. The original data would have a new column specify the topic class.
3. From the topics generated, you apply some classification ML to get the probabilities of a document falling in each of the generated topics. 
4. Then the model would be used to predict future data.

Thanks.

5/9/22, 8:08 PM - +234 909 880 8992: I think it is time we advocate for or educate both applicants and HR professionals on job posting because some of this guys will just go online and copy anything that looks like what they are employing for without having the technical details
5/9/22, 8:11 PM - +234 909 880 8992: I saw a job post that reads *junior Frontend Engineer* and you want Python, Java, Kotlin, wordpress and ability to use social media is an advantage. Oga how now
5/9/22, 8:16 PM - +234 903 783 8682: There's really nothing we can do about it.

Project managers are worse. They won't let you talk. They'll go online and read all sorts of stuff and come and complicate simple things for the team. 

That's why the best project managers are those that have technical background and later transitioned to project management. 

I've met one before. He was such a wonderful person. 
He will give you assignment and show you exactly how you'll solve the problem. You'll grow when you work with people like them. 

It's a pity that they're few especially in Nigeria where tech is still relatively young. I hope we all grow to become people like that for the future generation.

5/9/22, 9:14 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Guy that thing na we’re actually. 

I was stressed on that thing till I finally handed it over to Devops
5/9/22, 9:14 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But a new docker image is out now that fixes a bunch of those issues
5/9/22, 9:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s looking like a tool that will give Looker a chase sha
5/9/22, 9:15 PM - +234 816 484 7452: My first deployment was from scratch using a separate python environment and setting up a special Postgres DB for it
5/9/22, 9:15 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Actually , it is a beauty. 

I haven’t used looker before
5/9/22, 9:16 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You know that I don’t really like doing data visualization 

But my best data visualization with no stress was when I first touched Superset
5/9/22, 9:17 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It gives me some kind of chills and super power that I can convert every sql query whether complex or simple to a visual and I could do some mad 3D geographical visual too
5/9/22, 9:17 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I guess @2348027557589 is the one that can tell us how good looker is
5/9/22, 9:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Noted Boss
5/9/22, 9:22 PM - +234 703 845 5619: 👀
5/9/22, 9:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Looker is amazing. 

One of the major reasons is basically how they treat Dashboard like a software and not just a report. So you can apply software engineering principles (version controlling , testing, CI/CD etc.), and the semantic layer built on LookML really help makes the life of business user easy once the developer build the necessary explore that can interact with, so they don’t need to learn anything technical to use it
5/9/22, 9:26 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Nice
So dashboards can have versioning and hooks or triggers
5/9/22, 9:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But ridiculously expensive 😂

5/9/22, 10:03 PM - +234 802 825 9007: I don’t think it does, cos if you want to eventually debug or find out what is wrong with your model you might not be able to pin point it. You might spend so much time trying to optimize a model that cannot be improved further simply because the topic modeling was probably not done right. Basically, you’d be transferring errors from the topic modeling into the model you’re building as well as topic modeling also isn’t 100% right. A model is as good as the quality of data used to train it.

5/9/22, 10:23 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Thanks, is there any technique you'd recommend to achieve this.

The goal is to classify an activity description based on common themes/topics.

For example, if an activity description is describing a charity event or humanitarian event or something, the model would be able to somehow know..

5/9/22, 11:30 PM - +234 803 916 0301: Either way can work... 
But this has worked many times.

Use latent dirichlet allocation model

Test whether the distribution per activity description of hidden semantic information could predict the classes (charity or humanitarian etc)

Since the data is about <10^5; Train LDA Model on about 75% of the activity description (randomized sample).

Grab Topic distributions for every activity description using the LDA Model

Use Topic Distributions directly as feature vectors in supervised classification models (random forest preferably) and get F1-score.

Use the same LDA model(same hyperparameters) to get topic distributions for other 30% (unseen data)

Run supervised classification models again on the 30% vectors and see if this generalizes.

If the supervised F1-scores on the unseen data generalizes, then you can posit that the 70% topic model has identified latent semantic structure that persists over time in this activity description.

NB: test with at least 3 kfolds (different random state) to concretize your label

Then you are good to go.

Using the Power BI Client would mean, you have to do your dashboard first.

If you are comfortable with codes, you wouldn't bother. But someone that's an expert with Power Bi might favour this route.

5/10/22, 1:54 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 3, 4 and 5 are super important especially because i think we need to talk about it more. 

For 3, it is super important because the aesthetics of a dashboard is what grabs the users attention.
 
For 4, succes of your projects depend on this. Manage stakeholders closely from requirement gathering to delivery and monitoring adoption. As you go higher, it becomes even more critical.

For 5, understanding the business is also important because it helps you promise initiatives and also helps you deliver initiatives that the business will find useful

5/10/22, 1:56 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯
5/10/22, 1:59 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think every data professional will have to. If we think about the business and IT as stakeholders then yes. To your point DE will most likely interact more with IT and a little with the business. For every other person, it is probably the opposite.
5/10/22, 2:00 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For 3 it’s funnily many of the dashboards I have seen across many of my clients aren’t aesthetic like that 😃 but just simple dashboard capture the right metrics they need. 

I don’t know maybe they aren’t interested in all those stunning dashboards we see people publish as side projects 😂😂
5/10/22, 2:01 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Spot on
5/10/22, 2:02 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Many people don't know how to explain to their end users how to use data to make decisions
5/10/22, 2:02 PM - +234 803 353 6901: After so much efforts to get data, modelling and analysis, the end users majorly the stakeholders needs layman explanations too
5/10/22, 2:03 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Very important
5/10/22, 2:03 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Especially Communication
5/10/22, 2:03 PM - +234 813 687 5225: spot on👌🏿
5/10/22, 2:04 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Mckinsey will teach most of these things especially with issue problem tree Approach
5/10/22, 2:05 PM - +234 803 353 6901: You have don't have problem case before hand?
5/10/22, 2:05 PM - +234 803 353 6901: ✅✅
5/10/22, 2:05 PM - S+N Ayoade: Stakeholders comes in Levels but I feel what’s most important is 5. Not to be guru but understand the business needs.

Your problem solving skill depends on your understanding of the business which determines the flow of your analysis and visualization.

Communicating to stakeholders depends on your viz..
5/10/22, 2:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not clear
5/10/22, 2:07 PM - S+N Ayoade: Exactly!
5/10/22, 2:07 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Like a case study questions of what the stakeholders wants to do
5/10/22, 2:07 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Communication to stakeholders don’t necessarily depend on viz. Your viz will depend on the business requirements you have gathered. So communication in this instance will be multifaceted just as @2348180472075 explained. 

If you don’t know how to manage their expectations and gather requirements well you are in for a difficult ride.
5/10/22, 2:08 PM - +234 803 353 6901: The last line 😭😭😭
5/10/22, 2:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nah. 

Many time your case study and initiative you will propose will be dependent on your communication with stakeholders to understand their needs.
5/10/22, 2:08 PM - +234 803 353 6901: It will be difficult
5/10/22, 2:08 PM - +234 803 353 6901: 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
5/10/22, 2:08 PM - S+N Ayoade: Hmmm

Thanks Chief 😊
5/10/22, 2:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What are your pain-point ?

What are you trying to track ?

What is important to you ?

These are questions you will answer from all business stakeholders which will influence the initiative and solution you will propose as well as the data gathering you will do.
5/10/22, 2:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So you don’t just have a solution in mind you think they will need or find useful.
5/10/22, 2:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: However, some stakeholders can clueless sha😂
5/10/22, 2:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So you will be the one to understand the situation of things and then propose
5/10/22, 2:11 PM - S+N Ayoade: 😂
5/10/22, 2:12 PM - +234 803 353 6901: They just want results 🤣🤣🤣
5/10/22, 2:13 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Especially the FMCG people
5/10/22, 2:19 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Honestly, how can you turn interactive dashboard to contain all the information plain.

Like you don't want to interactive or sorts. You just want to view everything at a glance.

What's now the purpose of having interactive dashboards. We for just dey use Excel then.

Stakeholders can be difficult at times. But na my job be that, handle stakeholders.

5/10/22, 3:24 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Please I have a question. Anyone ever used Marquez or any data lineage solution before? Especially with Airflow. What’s a good time to have integrated into your workflows? Cc @2348108522573, @2348180472075 and everyone else who can help chip in.

Are there tools you’d recommend outside of Marquez/Openlineage?
5/10/22, 3:24 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Thank you so much for this

5/10/22, 3:26 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hmmm not used any yet. Data catalogs usually have lineage as a feature. So my plan is just to get a catalog that gives this feature and other.
5/10/22, 3:26 PM - +234 809 394 5219: thanks o
5/10/22, 3:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Why not just explore a good Data Catalogue tool @2348106129023 ? So you don’t have multiple stuff to maintain
5/10/22, 3:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Maybe add a separate tool for Observability if the pipeline has scale up.
5/10/22, 3:27 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Once you have a few pipelines and dashboards, you should put lineage in place.

5/10/22, 3:31 PM - +234 810 612 9023: The reason we’re considering Openlineage is because we’ll be using it with Datakin. Since datakin was acquired by Astronomer, it should be easy to integrate. Was just curious if there’d be a better approach.

If he rests, shareholders will kill him in his sleep.
5/10/22, 3:44 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes true, I think organisations try to fix bad data with the limited info they have but they don't do it with governance or data management principles. So usually the fixes are temporary. E.g. doing a data clean up without fixing the source of quality issues. 

What needs to happen is an awareness of data management principles. DAMAs DMBOK is a good one. This will guide them in going about it the right way.

It will be so slow. 

Imagine opening WhatsApp for the first day today by this time.

5/10/22, 7:19 PM - +234 802 825 9007: It's not easy design-wise, it's a scalability issue. And giving the fact that they aren't monetizing whatsapp yet, it's not really worth it. My opinion though
5/10/22, 7:20 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah.. Over 1Billion Homo sapiens on each  uses Whatsapp, .more often..

Some companies and business use it for their meetings , too...

Also do people have the mobile devices to handle it now.

Do you get, it takes so much to roll out even an update because some people might still be using WhatsApp on android 4.0 🤣☺️
5/10/22, 7:22 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Some phones don’t have play store but they are running WhatsApp 😂

I already have an automated web app that scrapes data for me (from Twitter) and also runs the sentiment analysis to fetch the polarity (and subjectivity) scores & label.

All ideas are welcomed please 🙏, I have about 72 hours to come up with something 🥺
5/11/22, 12:45 PM - +234 810 123 7090: From Prince Analyst. His WhatsApp be having issues. He can see  messages but can't send to the group.
Thanks for your anticipated Responses
5/11/22, 12:48 PM - +234 703 806 5681: What about email comm with other project coordinators and participants?

Channel discussions? 


Although I don't know what "project" means here.
5/11/22, 1:03 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Find where he has a presence legally and get the data. 

If it is very important and as a last resort, you can profile him and get data about people with similar profiles and perform your sentiment analysis. Then you can extrapolate.
5/11/22, 1:15 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I envy people with zero web presence
5/11/22, 1:27 PM - +234 813 556 4853: Really......why???
5/11/22, 1:30 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Hmmm 🤔🤔🤔
5/11/22, 1:34 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Sarcasm, I suppose🧐
5/11/22, 1:34 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Nope. That's some OG peer pressure resistance.

5/11/22, 2:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Hi @2347038065681 

Is this the time to buy in crypto ??

Because as everything is going down and turning red, it is tempting 😅
5/11/22, 2:04 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Do you believe in Crypto? That it will rise again?

On the long term, I think Crypto is the future. It go rise las las.
5/11/22, 2:05 PM - +234 813 312 7971: Lmaooo…. Why won’t it rise?
5/11/22, 2:08 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I still Dey wait for my financial expert  @2347038065681 because it is really tempting right now to go and buy oo
5/11/22, 2:08 PM - +234 805 266 5227: <Media omitted>
5/11/22, 2:16 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Buy what?
5/11/22, 2:17 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Oh this.

I personally wouldn't throw in money for now.
5/11/22, 2:22 PM - +234 816 170 8710: Why??🤔🤔
5/11/22, 2:23 PM - +234 813 312 7971: Truth is there’s no perfect time to buy 

It’s always better to buy using DCA….buy in trenches
5/11/22, 2:24 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Heightened volatility and sell-offs.

I think it'll go deeper. There's extreme fear in the market.

So, personally I would wait. Watch how things play out. Meanwhile, select the tokens I want to invest in.

Then enter in bits. DCA.
5/11/22, 2:24 PM - +234 703 806 5681: True.

But I'm referring to my own buy strategy, not giving financial advice.
5/11/22, 2:24 PM - +234 813 312 7971: I’ve jejely been waiting for 20k because there’s crazy feud now
5/11/22, 2:39 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Create an hypothetical table/ Database on any DBMS , with the given info. Test run the code, u would get to know n learn better that way .
5/11/22, 2:40 PM - +234 706 439 6712: U can use Postgres on Pgadmin or any other convenient to you .
5/11/22, 2:41 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Datagrip is cool actually, if  u know how to use it.
5/11/22, 2:52 PM - +234 816 484 7452: We gather dey
5/11/22, 2:53 PM - +234 703 932 8188: There is more fundamental analysis affecting the market now than technical.

If you are an investor.  You  can accumulate in bits using dollar cost average.

But again, the market is currently in a zone where the probability of more sell off in higher than buy.

So, I will wait for signs of market reversal in direction.

But again. DYODD. 🙏
5/11/22, 2:54 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Thanks @2347038065681 , @2348133127971  and @2347039328188 

I will keep waiting for it to plummet
5/11/22, 3:01 PM - +234 810 685 8679: Na small small, we go reach 20k
5/11/22, 3:06 PM - +234 813 324 1349: The possible output is all about the concept of left join.

Left table - Loan
Right Table - Users





All columns on the left table(Loan) will be returned regardless of whether a row from the left table has a matching row from the right table(User).

If there is no match, the columns from the right table(Users) will contain NULL.

Also for the where clause, it will filter it by the due date when is >= “2018-01-01” and then ordered it in descending order I.e the least date will be 2018-01-01.

ID - It's gonna return all rows
Amount due - It's going to retuned all rows
Due date - It's going to return all rows.
First name - This column might contain NULL
Last  name - This column might contain NULL

In summary, if the loan id has no users, the values in the first name and last name are NULL.

1. He doesn't have much presence on the social media.

2. He lead >10 projects, but even these projects do not have much presence online.

How can/should/do I go ahead to get data for my sentiment analysis.

PS:

I already have an automated web app that scrapes data for me (from Twitter) and also runs the sentiment analysis to fetch the polarity (and subjectivity) scores & label.

5/11/22, 5:01 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Maybe I should propose that they carry out a survey on the beneficiaries of the projects he had initiated, then we can run the sentiment analysis

I've adjusted my strategy.

No buying for a while. Weird things are happening in that space.

I fear liquidity will dry up for a while.

Plus BUSD is more transparent than USDT.

And I trust CZ do manage the former.
5/12/22, 7:37 AM - +234 813 312 7971: It’s CZ guy I don’t trust
5/12/22, 7:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I do. He's also transparent. And BUSD is constantly audited
5/12/22, 7:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: He runs the largest exchange in the world, and in the US its closely monitored.

I don't honestly believe he'll disappear lol. Dem go catch am.

5/12/22, 8:24 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Cash is king.

Liquidate some, invest in naira denominated assets like mutual funds so you don't freeze liquidity.
5/12/22, 8:24 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I'm releasing a mutual funds investment video on youtube today.

5/12/22, 8:32 AM - +234 703 806 5681: A crypto wipe out can happen in a matter of minutes
5/12/22, 8:33 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Risevest works like an ETF of sorts.

If you don't want to manage your own portfolio, then they're worth giving a trial.

Alternatively, you can just invest in ETFs by yourself.
5/12/22, 8:34 AM - +234 703 806 5681: This is the time to stress test your will and portfolio allocation power 🫠

5/12/22, 8:36 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Every market is hit. Some more than others. This is exactly why irrespective of your risk appetite, you need to allocate investment to low risk options that will help you manage liquidity and preserve capital.
5/12/22, 8:36 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Fee is high sha. But yeah they do the same thing
5/12/22, 8:37 AM - +234 703 806 5681: But most, if not all, funds are making losses now.
5/12/22, 8:37 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Very true, everywhere is bleeding.
5/12/22, 8:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: some more than others
5/12/22, 8:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: If you'll buy stocks, checks fundamentals well - qualitative and quantitative. I'll teach this soon
5/12/22, 8:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: And it's not every dip you should buy. Understand why the dip is happening.
5/12/22, 8:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Also don't let the sunk cost effect be your Achilles heel
5/12/22, 8:40 AM - +234 817 840 3767: Moya look away from digital assets, stocks, bonds or even treasury Bill's for now.... Real Estate, Gold, Cars and other physical assets might just be the way to go for now
5/12/22, 8:40 AM - +234 703 806 5681: you can buy REITS for real estate
5/12/22, 8:40 AM - +234 703 806 5681: eevn Gold ETFs
5/12/22, 8:41 AM - +234 817 840 3767: Maybe also investing in startups or growing one yourself with a few friends
5/12/22, 8:42 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Invest for the long term. I know thinking about 10 years feels weird, but that should be your horizon so your portfolio can weather its storms without you panicking.
5/12/22, 8:42 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Still high risk. Ask VCs how many fail.
5/12/22, 8:44 AM - +234 813 151 7157: Even the US real estate market is taking  hits😩
Meanwhile, an NSE index I follow has returned around 20% YTD. Diversification is key like you've said.
5/12/22, 8:45 AM - +234 817 840 3767: Emphasis on growing one yourself.  That way you aren't the VC and COULD have control over how things go, to a reasonable extent, since you're actively involved
5/12/22, 8:45 AM - +234 817 840 3767: MTN shares for now, real Estate investments too. Though real estate must be in a secured location with a secured company, especially when dealing with Nigerian Realtors.  My thoughts though
5/12/22, 8:47 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Buy Nigerian stocks o.

Don't look down on our market 😁

It's great for dividends
5/12/22, 8:47 AM - +234 817 840 3767: True!

Upon all our Catherine woods expensive subscriptions 😂😂😂
5/12/22, 9:02 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s what I have been cost averaging on oo.

5/12/22, 9:03 AM - +234 703 806 5681: yeah
5/12/22, 9:03 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Ehn ehn, I don forget sef. I sha know the subscription was expensive. We were thinking of making money😂😂😂
5/12/22, 9:03 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Even Risevest don divest their stock assets several times in the last 15 months
5/12/22, 9:04 AM - +234 817 840 3767: @2347038065681  what's up with user of Royal Q?? Will the app make Intelligent decisions at this time?
5/12/22, 9:04 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I think you're very heavy in Tech stocks. Balance out a bit more... consumer goods, dividend-paying and ETFs. They've taken lower hits than tech companies.
5/12/22, 9:04 AM - +234 813 312 7971: They were shocked 😂😂😂😂

We need to sue them 😂😂😂

One of my stocks was -70%, only God knows what is remaining on that stock now😂😂
5/12/22, 9:04 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks for this. Can one use historical data to make informed decisions. This would be an interesting project
5/12/22, 9:04 AM - +234 817 840 3767: Please do😒... I'm seriously interested
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I never touch auto-trading bots.
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Even with the diversification, the market overall is not smiling
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Been following CNNMoney forecast until they led me to gbese
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - +234 817 840 3767: 😊🤭... I can imagine
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - +234 810 685 8679: We re still going to touch 22k and probably 18k
5/12/22, 9:05 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Yes. But when it comes to stocks, past performance is not a 100% (not even 90%) indicator of future performance.
5/12/22, 9:06 AM - +234 810 685 8679: Nd about the bull, don't expect 100k at all.
5/12/22, 9:06 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Anticipating
5/12/22, 9:06 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/12/22, 9:06 AM - +234 703 806 5681: yes. but a more resilient portfolio will not dip as much as when you're heavy into one sector only
5/12/22, 9:06 AM - +234 813 312 7971: You people holding without setting SL.

The last crash showed me mad pepper. I’m never holding without SL.

The market has been so unstable since last year for crypto.
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I have others but yeah more of Tech growth stocks.
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - +234 803 884 6009: What is SL please?
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - +234 813 312 7971: That’s what the chart is saying and I hope it’s true so I can buy then 😂
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Beta is an important indicator too while stock picking.
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - +234 703 806 5681: stop loss
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Well well

They said it already hold for 3-5 years and predicted the market will be crazy at some point, so that’s why I am not terrified sha
5/12/22, 9:07 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Oh..okay
5/12/22, 9:08 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Are you a financial expert ni?
5/12/22, 9:08 AM - +234 703 806 5681: When you buy crypto, you can set a stop-loss, which in essence triggers a sale of that asset when the price drops to a certain level
5/12/22, 9:08 AM - +234 813 312 7971: That’s why am not even bothered….. any money I put on those stuffs is gonna be there for long
5/12/22, 9:08 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Yes and you’ll soon start paying for her services
5/12/22, 9:09 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/12/22, 9:09 AM - +234 803 884 6009: But does this not negate the whole point of keeping your investments for a longer period of time
5/12/22, 9:09 AM - +234 703 806 5681: The only time this bearish market should scare you is if you have not been planning your finances well. So zero cash means your money is tied to an investment that's currently losing money.
5/12/22, 9:09 AM - +234 810 685 8679: Nd I hope u bag good coin

5/12/22, 9:10 AM - +234 703 806 5681: In a way, Yes. I use SL when I'm spot trading, not when I'm doing longterm investments.
5/12/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 884 6009: I see.. thank you
5/12/22, 9:10 AM - +234 803 884 6009: This is addressed to you @2347038065681

That’s the privilege we are enjoying here. Free Personal Finance nuggets, so be only Data we dey learn. 

Thanks @2347038065681
5/12/22, 9:12 AM - +234 703 806 5681: But when a buy has drifted from the reason you bought (fundamental principles), you may have to decide whether it's time to sell. Sometimes it's okay to take a loss and move on.
5/12/22, 9:12 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Abeg who has don R assessment on edx, on indexing, wrangling

5/12/22, 9:12 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Just wrangling for me. What course are you taking?
5/12/22, 9:12 AM - +234 813 312 7971: From my experience of trading crypto coins and investing in stocks… they’re different 


Crypto coin crash is way crazier, a coin can dip and never recover.

Plus I don’t hold in a very unstable condition….

If you’ve been following the crypto market well, you’ll understand the uncertainty in it.

Sometimes not trading or holding gives a better ROI.
5/12/22, 9:13 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Hmmn
Fundamental principles
5/12/22, 9:13 AM - +234 706 439 6712: How about Dangote shares? Good buy? 

( Asking with his refinery in mind 🧐😋🙃)
5/12/22, 9:13 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2348133127971 

You see why I told you I am very skeptical of going heavy on the asset class 😂😂😂
5/12/22, 9:14 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Okay. We look forward to you creating one 🤗🤗
5/12/22, 9:14 AM - +234 803 884 6009: I see..
Thank you for giving a better context
5/12/22, 9:15 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Data Science : R Basics
5/12/22, 9:16 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Prof Irizarry. good course
5/12/22, 9:16 AM - +234 813 312 7971: There’s level to holding in crypto. Don’t get carried away with greediness.

Sometimes it’s better to just trade/hold short time.

Also, have a trading strategy, a 10% or 15% monthly is not bad.

I don’t even buy coins unless there’s a crazy dip. 

Overtime when you lose money, you’ll know what works for you.
5/12/22, 9:16 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Aswear😂😂😂😂
5/12/22, 9:16 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Yeah

5/12/22, 5:53 PM - +234 708 674 2097: 1. Datalake is the storing of data in their row form( structured, semi structured, unstructured). This storage doesn't care about the  immediate needs of downstream users. It allows them to go to the store and pick up the data they needs. This data are mostly used by the ML and AI guys. This the work of the data engineers @2348164847452 @2347033167142 and co.

While
5/12/22, 5:54 PM - +234 708 674 2097: The data warehouse storage does the OLAP(online analytic process) job. The storage allows a transformation process (ETL) on the raw that then prepare it for *Analytics*. It does the batch Analytics tin, that's it stores data first and later analyse it.  That makes it different from *database* that deals with a real-time data.  
Ask @2348180472075

5/12/22, 6:46 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Actually @2347086742097 has done major justice to the question actually but If I would add anything, it would be the following
5/12/22, 6:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: *Data Lake* - This is pretty much or most times an object or cloud storage you use to house data in its raw format. From Structured to semi-structured and unstructured data. The good thing about it is that it accepts data in all format but the downside to it most times is that you don't get the simple advantages you get with a Data Warehouse like querying your data, having ACID BASE transactions and operations with data. 

You have to implement data governance and policies yourself so your data lake doesn't become a *DATA SWAMP* .
But these days there are a bunch of technologies out there that helps put in all of these things in place and help implement a good functioning data lake properly. examples are LakeFS which is bring git versioning to Data Environments, some refer to it as the perfect data management tools. Another tool is Delta Lake which is used to upgrade the data lake by making it possible for you to perform ACID BASE transactions on data artefacts in your data lake because you are able to save your structured data as Delta Tables that you can write SQL queries against and also delta lake brings it data governance and management to your data lake because it does versioning out of the box, meta data handling and also keeps the logs of your data artefacts at different point so you are able to perform time travel operations on your data assets

 Some other the cool advantages of this is you are able to store your data for long with less cost and you are also able to separate your storage layer from your computing layer in your data environment or infrastructure.
5/12/22, 7:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: *Data Warehouse* - I would keep it short here as this is the defacto run to environment for structured data on a wide scale, And there are a bunch of technologies out there that handles this and implements this in different strategies, so it is up to you to sit it out with Data Engineers and other Data Experts to figure out what suits your use case best. 

With this , Business teams are able to perform analytics on a wide scale..

The major downside to Data Warehouses is the fact that you cannot handle unstructured data and also it takes some special kind of skill and implementations to handle semi-structured data.
5/12/22, 7:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But it would be unfair to talk about those two without talking about the LakeHouse and Data Mesh.
5/12/22, 7:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: So remember for the data lake, remember I said that there are technologies people used to handle it flaws. 

So in actual sense ehn,

A LakeHouse is actually *Data Lake + Data Warehouse*

*A lakehouse* builds upon the strength and flaws of these two technologies and concepts.

So Ideally when you use Delta Lake to handle the flaws of a typical data lake, you are actually implementing a Lakehouse.

The easiest way to implement the LakeHouse is by using *Databricks* environment out of the box with any of your cloud or object storage or any file system of your choice be it Hadoop FS, LakeFS or even minIO storage

5/12/22, 7:12 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Though you can also have the Open Source implementation of the Lakehouse by setting up your environment and infrastructure yourself by using Open source tools and environment by following the following steps.

Remember that the Lakehouse and data lake can handle both batch streaming data.

- Have a cloud or object storage of your choice or any file system that support delta lake
- Spark Environment with Delta Lake Packages and jar configured and installed(So you have access to all of Databricks Delta Lake Capabilities). - So you can code in Pyspark via a jupyter notebook, scalar or any programming language of your choice using the Delta Lake Spark API for the language you prefer.
- LakeFS to bring in git versioning and Data Management to your big data or normal data environment
- Airflow for Workflow Orchestration and Scheduling
- And since it is a Lakehouse, it can speak to other technologies like *dbt* , *Airbyte* etc
-
5/12/22, 7:13 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Lastly - A *Data Mesh*
5/12/22, 7:15 PM - +234 816 484 7452: So you can see a data mesh as you designing an end to end data infrastructure or environment with the domain or business or industry concerned being at the center of your design.

So you design the environment to meet the past, future and present needs of that particular domain.

A real life example is this

5/12/22, 7:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Ommoo see text book 🙌🙌
5/12/22, 7:21 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I am sorry for spamming at this point, 

Just imagine that you have petabytes and zetabytes of data sha and you know that you won't be querying historical data of like say 10 - 15 years soon but maybe once in a while. In a typical scenario ehn, having everything in a typical data warehouse would consume so much space and storage."

Lets me use something small, You are using Postgres for your data warehouse implementation, and your data size is like 100Gb but you know that you hardly query a large part of the data. What you can do here is to have your historical data in a Lakehouse or normal data in parquet format or delta table format hereby shrinking your 100Gb to about 25Gb in parquet but you connect your lakehouse to your Postgres using *parquet_fdw* , So that you can query your red hot data which can be around 5Gb on Postgres and from Postgres environment, you can query your historical data which is 25Gb in size from the data lake or lakehouse
5/12/22, 7:22 PM - +234 818 047 2075: See content, You should write a book
5/12/22, 7:22 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly what came to my mind

5/12/22, 7:23 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And yes, the Big techs and big Enterprise companies use Lakehouse and Data Mesh Strategy but it is not common

So it is implementable. 
One or two Nigerian Companies already try this but you can't know except you work for them

5/13/22, 2:07 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Marketing strategy,I presume
5/13/22, 2:08 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Let me try and give a summary 

Standard deviation is a measure of spread. It gives an idea of how close the data elements are to the central measure (mean, median and mode).  A measure of the stastical precision.

So, in this case, you can use the spread to detect outliers or factor samples that disrupt the distribution. 

 For example,  you can decide to take only data that falls between one or standard deviation of the central measure.

Just this for 1.2 ko possible 😂😂
5/13/22, 11:38 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But Dimension Modeling and DW isn’t less of DE really,  it’s all depend on the organization you work with.
5/13/22, 11:40 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah. It depends on the company
5/13/22, 11:41 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Na y some of us dey push for U.S /U.K 


Solid rapas😋
5/13/22, 11:45 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah 

Doing Dimension Modeling and DW  well is as equally important as migrating and build resilient infrastructure really
5/13/22, 11:50 PM - +234 903 008 2871: I dey reason am too

e be like blood money!

they say 1.5 to 2.om
5/13/22, 11:52 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I think that's about the same amount an Army  general gets as Salary, in Nigeria.. Correct me if m wrong
5/13/22, 11:52 PM - +234 903 008 2871: they con put negotiable again

5/14/22, 1:17 AM - +234 814 833 4339: What does an analytics engineer do?
5/14/22, 1:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Make the right Data available for folks that need to use the Data (DA, DS & Business stakeholders)
5/14/22, 1:27 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They build Data Pipelines like DEs but are more vertical and business focused as against the DE that’s heavy more on the infrastructure core technical stuff. 

With the AE the Data Scientist don’t need to do any initial Data preparation. He just dive straight into EDA because the data is ready for use.
5/14/22, 1:41 AM - +234 802 755 7589: Thanks Chief!!
5/14/22, 4:53 AM - +234 903 783 8682: https://www.dataversity.net/data-scientist-vs-data-engineer/#

🤔
5/14/22, 4:56 AM - +234 903 783 8682: It's about the value you add to the company.
Companies are businesses, they don't care about the difficulty or technicality of your job. If you like use Excel or pandas they don't care as long as they're getting the result.
5/14/22, 6:01 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly sir
5/14/22, 6:02 AM - +234 706 439 6712: It's not by how many tools u can use.. It's by problems u can solve with those tools......
5/14/22, 6:27 AM - +234 806 926 8443: 🫡
5/14/22, 6:33 AM - +234 706 439 6712: I love this...just the reality
5/14/22, 6:51 AM - +234 903 783 8682: So, are you saying prospective data scientists should abort their mission and port to data engineering?
5/14/22, 6:58 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Not at all... But are very important and both needs each other .

If u read carefully it's states " Both Data science and Data Engineering are here to stay" 


The article was trying point out the similarities and discrepancies that exist with both.


Consider Data Engineering as the PA of Data Science
5/14/22, 7:11 AM - +234 903 783 8682: PA?! Some people here will take this personal. You're on your own óò.

On a lighter note, I think data scientists should strengthen their Machine Learning, Derp Learning and Artificial intelligence skills as well as mathematics. That's the surest way to have an edge in this fast paced world.

They should go beyond model.fit
5/14/22, 7:11 AM - +234 903 783 8682: And guys should strengthen their pandas. 

Hmmm, e get why.
5/14/22, 7:13 AM - Mascot (Nafisat): <Media omitted>
5/14/22, 7:14 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Senior, 1m.

I think they should do better especially with this inflation.
5/14/22, 7:23 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Data engineers dwell heavily on Databases, building, Making it accessible, tracking, automating entries, flows and delivery , to the Data Analyst and Data scientist which would clean and transform the data, draw insights from the "cooked " and "ready-to--use" data to train on some Machine leaning models ( or other deep learning tools as the case may be ) ,for predictive analysis, based on Historical trajectory .
5/14/22, 7:31 AM - +234 814 833 4339: Ookayy
5/14/22, 7:40 AM - +234 701 047 4062: Please na

5/14/22, 8:38 AM - +234 806 742 5278: Help me ask her oooo😅
5/14/22, 8:39 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: PA??
5/14/22, 8:40 AM - +234 806 742 5278: God when 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
5/14/22, 9:04 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: ML is like a necessity for a DS na 😂 

I don’t think a good DS won’t be strong with ML (maybe you want to say an add-in a DS can have is MLOps ). 

And DE isn’t the PA of DS, they are all separate and work to complement one another. A DS becomes useless if there is no DE or he/she is forced to do DE work , and a DE on the other hand can’t build predictive models which the business need, so they work separately towards a common goal - Using Data to drive value. 

I’m working with a client that has the full squad data team - DE/AE/DS/DA/MLOps and I can say everyone’s work complement each other.  When I reach out to the DE for some stuff baba won’t even answer me and would direct me to AE. And this is where bottlenecks start existing which birth the need of Data Governance &Cataloguing.
5/14/22, 9:05 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And I think @2348163815935 shared an article here one time in upskilling beyond *model.fit* Data scientist
5/14/22, 9:07 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Many data science courses teach only python, pandas and matplotlib/seaborn
5/14/22, 9:07 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Well many courses out there are parallel to what exist outside.
5/14/22, 9:08 AM - +234 703 806 5681: A course can't teach you everything na.
5/14/22, 9:08 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Well Udacity tried sha
5/14/22, 9:09 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Still the best out there on DS - They covered every aspect plus build Data pipelines and deploying your model.
5/14/22, 9:09 AM - +234 903 783 8682: How much is it?
5/14/22, 9:09 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I heard their courses are very expensive
5/14/22, 9:10 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025
5/14/22, 9:12 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Almost 800k if the student will spend 4months.

Hmmm. Not beans.
5/14/22, 9:13 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: There is a work around to take them sha  it if you aren’t interested in certificate like me.
5/14/22, 9:14 AM - +234 903 783 8682: There are free platforms that offer decent contents.

And there are paid but affordable platforms that offer decent contents.
5/14/22, 9:16 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I wasn't asked for a single certificate in all the interviews I've attended.

They only ask me "what projects have you done?", "take this scenario, how will you solve it?"
5/14/22, 9:16 AM - +234 903 783 8682: So, please share the work around.

5/14/22, 10:25 AM - +234 818 047 2075: 🙏🙏
5/14/22, 10:25 AM - +234 703 678 8365: Personally I think it's dependent on the market. Nigerian market doesn't require so much from you outside these. I think there's a blog post by someone here detailing on the Nigerian and foreign market. Will try and get it for you.
5/14/22, 10:27 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Learn:
* best practices 
* performane tuning
* learn how to build aesthetically appealing and functional dashboards. You can watch Leonardo Karpinski videos to understand this point
* focus on business acumen and translating business needs into analytics solutions
5/14/22, 10:28 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks for sharing. This is it 

 https://link.medium.com/SVRdcJHh1pb
5/14/22, 10:29 AM - +234 703 678 8365: @2349059392803
5/14/22, 10:29 AM - +234 818 047 2075: These may sound easy but tbh may take you another 1-2 years to master all the points
5/14/22, 10:30 AM - +234 703 678 8365: Be versatile. Try learn more than one Viz tool.
5/14/22, 10:31 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Thanks for this
5/14/22, 10:32 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Tableau and power bi
5/14/22, 10:32 AM - +234 703 678 8365: Exactly. Run from any place that tells you that you can master it all in a month.
5/14/22, 10:33 AM - +234 905 939 2803: What do u mean by performance tuning
5/14/22, 10:33 AM - +234 802 413 5885: This is true…
5/14/22, 10:33 AM - +234 905 939 2803: So true
5/14/22, 10:34 AM - +234 802 413 5885: Personally, I feel AEs are closer to being DEs than DAs…
5/14/22, 10:36 AM - +234 708 531 6273: ✅
5/14/22, 10:36 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Example an athelete running at 13 min for a 100m track how can you improve him/her to run at 9min
5/14/22, 10:37 AM - +234 818 047 2075: How fast your dashboards load. This can be a very big problem if you for example work in financial services or Telcos. In SQL and Powerzbi, there are multiple approaches to solve same problem but some are more expensive than others from a performance point of view.
5/14/22, 10:38 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Exactly
5/14/22, 10:38 AM - +234 818 047 2075: An example i experienced was when my team worked with about 1 billion rows in a bank. All our queries were running for days and timing out. Also PowerBi was running out of memory. Learning best practices prevents things like this
5/14/22, 10:39 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Okay
5/14/22, 10:40 AM - +234 818 047 2075: So things like indexing, avoid using functions in where clauses, avoid using certain PowerBi functions in your Dax, do complex transformations in the db not PowerBi etc.
5/14/22, 10:40 AM - +234 818 047 2075: You can just search for best practices in SQL and PBI, you will find them. Some others will come when you hit roadblocks on the job
5/14/22, 10:44 AM - +234 703 678 8365: À simple place to start from is an excel document with 24,000 X 20(size) coupled with several formulars, formating and macros will paint a good picture.
5/14/22, 10:44 AM - +234 818 047 2075: 👍
5/14/22, 10:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯
5/14/22, 10:46 AM - +234 905 939 2803: How pls
5/14/22, 10:46 AM - +234 703 678 8365: Stared **
5/14/22, 10:47 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Spot on.
5/14/22, 10:47 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yop. 

You are correct.
5/14/22, 10:48 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I don’t even do anything report or Dashboard at all, I always have another team member that work with me on any project who will build Dashboard, so mine is to understand the business requirements and report to be developed and make a clean data available to do it. 

So you are right.
5/14/22, 10:48 AM - +234 703 678 8365: Is this where code refactoring plays a good role?
5/14/22, 10:49 AM - +234 802 413 5885: This makes the work quite easier for the person creating dashboards and reporting.

The fact that you understand the business requirements and the needs of the DA makes you a better AE

👍🏾
5/14/22, 10:50 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes we refactored all our code multiple times. Project ran for 2 years 💀💀. 6month project o.
5/14/22, 10:51 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Omo
5/14/22, 10:51 AM - +234 706 942 4890: 😬😬
5/14/22, 10:52 AM - +234 802 413 5885: Just out of inquisition, don’t you think indexing would consume more storage space or how do you go about it?
5/14/22, 10:52 AM - +234 818 415 3106: "Avoid"
5/14/22, 10:52 AM - +234 818 047 2075: After the project, I said in my life I will never underestimate the role of a data engineer. We didn't have any on that project that is why it was a disaster. We were all analysts
5/14/22, 10:53 AM - +234 703 678 8365: Oh oh now I see.
5/14/22, 10:53 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes it will. There is just a tradeoff. Performance or storage? You need to decide. But with huge data, you probably need it
5/14/22, 10:53 AM - +234 802 413 5885: Oh, we should avoid indexing..

Thanks
5/14/22, 10:53 AM - +234 802 413 5885: Alright…

Thanks for the clarity
5/14/22, 10:54 AM - +234 818 415 3106: E be like i dey wrong ooo
5/14/22, 10:54 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Let the DEs address this. They should share their thoughts on indexing
5/14/22, 10:54 AM - +234 803 884 6009: I think indexing is always very important especially for records that you would have to keep calling
5/14/22, 10:55 AM - +234 802 413 5885: We dey learn boss
5/14/22, 10:56 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Not “avoid”
I think you just need to be sure what you want to create your index on
Luckily, most of these cloud solutions like Azure do your index and tuning for you
5/14/22, 10:57 AM - +234 802 413 5885: Okay..
5/14/22, 10:58 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Ideally, the 1 billion rows of data won't have much near real-time insight to give to the business. A lambda architecture should have been employed. The batch layer will help process old data with a data lake analytics tool, and the speed layer will use a streaming tool to process it and consolidate the view. Problem solved. That is why data engineers are important 😅
5/14/22, 10:59 AM - +234 905 939 2803: 🤯🤯
5/14/22, 10:59 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Performance tuning and optimization varies from db/DW you are using and how it is handled, and what I am looking at improving.

For Bigquery I don’t need Indexiig I just need to Partition and Cluster my tables well based on how I need them to be queried faster. 

For Redshift I can use Distkey/sort key, table compression or use concurrent scaling and elastic resize to handle huge workload. 

I just started working on Snowflake and I believe it will have it own optimization technique
5/14/22, 11:00 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And also there are trade-of you also consider for optimization, and with Cloud DW storage is the least of the problem because it’s relatively cheap atleast.
5/14/22, 11:00 AM - +234 905 939 2803: I'm lost
5/14/22, 11:02 AM - +234 803 884 6009: These techniques are totally new and like you said, I think you just need to understand the tool you work with and how you would optimize your queries in those tools/ service
5/14/22, 11:04 AM - +234 802 413 5885: Thank you very much for this
5/14/22, 11:04 AM - +234 803 884 6009: I honestly think these things come with experience
5/14/22, 11:04 AM - +234 803 884 6009: There is just a lot to learn
5/14/22, 11:05 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 

At some levels it’s not about the code is working 😂😂
5/14/22, 11:05 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Currently, yhh
5/14/22, 11:05 AM - +234 905 939 2803: 🤯
5/14/22, 11:05 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Even the pros are still learning
5/14/22, 11:06 AM - +234 803 884 6009: I think it’s just best to take it one step at a time, learn on the job
5/14/22, 11:06 AM - +234 803 884 6009: Once you know the basics, take one tool, master it before moving onto the next
5/14/22, 11:07 AM - +234 803 884 6009: I am telling you
5/14/22, 11:07 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Like @2348180472075 optimization is now  very important. 

SELECT distinct (category) will work but you don’t want to run that on a huge dataset because it’s not a well optimized query 😂, so you have to find a way to get same resume writing an optimized query. 

You will start considering when when a query will do full scan of your dataset or just a partial or seek approach. 

For now just master the basics and fundamental
5/14/22, 11:07 AM - +234 803 884 6009: The quality of your codes too
5/14/22, 11:08 AM - +234 803 884 6009: 💯
5/14/22, 11:08 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: ~resume~

5/14/22, 11:11 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omoo

This one 😂😂😥

If you work with a Software Engineer turn Data Engineer you go see hell 😂😂😂😭
5/14/22, 11:11 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I worked with one haaaaaaaaaaa

I was frustrated and always lamenting.
5/14/22, 11:12 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Thanks @2348163815935  for —no-verify 😂😂😂😂😂
5/14/22, 11:14 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You don’t know how this simple stuff you shared saved my life. 

I have been in a code that has worked and okay but just to commit took me like 5hrs to fix comma 😭😭😭 because precommit won’t let me commit my code. 

The day you mentioned —no-verify, once I don see everything fine and well formatted any nonsense error I no verify am commit straight 😂😂
5/14/22, 11:17 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Another question. As an entry level DA, how do u get employed?
5/14/22, 11:18 AM - +234 703 316 7142: It depends on the the rate of reads on the table of interest. Indexes takes storage on its own and can be more than half the storage of data itself depending on columns you indexed.
5/14/22, 11:19 AM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌👌
5/14/22, 11:19 AM - +234 703 316 7142: 👍🏽
5/14/22, 11:20 AM - +234 818 047 2075: It was a bank so it was purely on prem. The stagingdb was SQL server. How do you think this could have been structured better?
5/14/22, 11:32 AM - +234 708 531 6273: The architecture can still be reproduced on-prem. Spark integrates well with SQL server too.  Spark will be used on both the batch and speed layer. The idea is to make the speed layer process only the data needed by the by the business in near-real-time. A spark job will process the batch data at a later time when the business won't be impacted(probably midnight). The consolidated view of what is needed is what the dashboards will be displaying.
5/14/22, 11:34 AM - +234 708 531 6273: The only drawback is that you won't have a "true" view until the next spark job. The business will decide the level of latency that is not too serious .
5/14/22, 11:40 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Do more real- life  projects, get involved and active in data communities like this, opportunities are always there...  Shared almost everyday....apply to any.. Or do freelancing to ( upwork,  fiverr..e.t.c)    if ur the type that don't really fancy a 9-5 job like me
5/14/22, 11:52 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Freelancing as an entry level?
5/14/22, 11:52 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Forget the later den... Focus on d former
5/14/22, 11:53 AM - +234 706 439 6712: 😁

5/14/22, 11:53 AM - +234 803 884 6009: 😂😂
5/14/22, 11:55 AM - S+N Ayoade: As an entry level, it means you’ve got the required skills but not the experience required. 

So yea, you can freelance to gather experience on working with real life data analytics projects
5/14/22, 11:56 AM - +234 706 439 6712: God bless you
5/14/22, 11:56 AM - +234 809 183 1446: Freelancing as an entry level isn't bad tho, just don't start with neck breaking projects if you know you can't handle it.. but it's a great way to gain some exp.
5/14/22, 11:57 AM - +234 903 783 8682: By constant practice, checking out other people's works and reading materials written by and for experienced people.

This is a general guide.
5/14/22, 11:57 AM - S+N Ayoade: @2348147532530 can mentor him/her on handling neck breaking gigs 😂

5/14/22, 12:00 PM - +234 706 439 6712: This would help... Check out others projects.   Try to learn from.. Practice...practice, ask question....n more practices, *consistently*..

Not good for business
5/14/22, 12:38 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
For SQL server there is a major indexing tactic for scenarios like this. I would check if I can still get the piece I have on indexing techniques.

But I know that, apart from code refactoring from source to report, 
You can break the tables into smaller partitions. And index from source.

Whereby all other tables and reporting views would come from that source .
5/14/22, 12:39 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
This is another approach
5/14/22, 12:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
5/14/22, 12:40 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you 🙂🙂
5/14/22, 12:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂

But you have learnt premium stuffs while working with him
5/14/22, 12:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah, it does that for sql too
5/14/22, 12:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Flake8 and black are for
Python
5/14/22, 12:41 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Auto correct can land you in trouble
5/14/22, 12:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah yeah 

I’ve used Black  before
5/14/22, 12:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Premium stuff actually.
5/14/22, 12:52 PM - +234 810 878 6913: This one still dy 😂😂😂
5/14/22, 12:52 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Instead of here, autocorrect will make one write her 🤣🤣🤣
5/14/22, 1:05 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Forgot to mention. Refactoring gave us a 10-20% improvement but indexing gave about 60%. We index columns we were using in where clauses.
5/14/22, 1:15 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Hello,
Who here works as a Data person in a financial institution?
5/14/22, 1:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Shoot your question.
5/14/22, 1:22 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Not a question per say.
Want to know the individual's experience working in a financial institution so I can mirror it in an application I want to submit.
5/14/22, 1:23 PM - +234 806 842 8052: <Media omitted>
5/14/22, 1:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It relative actually. If you are coming in as an entry level or Junior role then the fundamental DA skills should be what you should tailor your application to, but if you are coming in as experienced hire then an experience in the finance space will be required. 

For entry don’t stress
5/14/22, 1:25 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Alrighty.
5/14/22, 1:25 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Thank you so much.

5/14/22, 1:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Entry??
5/14/22, 1:26 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Yeah.
5/14/22, 1:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I don’t think you need any because you will most likely learn on the job.

5/14/22, 2:17 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s what is closer to her based on her past experience
5/14/22, 2:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: She can equally pivot to DS/ML which will require learning sure but DE/AE is much easier for her.
5/14/22, 2:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Someone like you can decide to pivot to Data Governance or DRE with your experience around risk , revenue assurance and all if that interest you.
5/14/22, 2:20 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I was actually thinking of DA. I did not even know much about the DE role until I met @2347060577846
5/14/22, 2:20 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Hmmnn
It can be a lot TBH
5/14/22, 2:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Don’t start learning dbt trust me.

5/14/22, 10:29 PM - +234 904 894 6475: This is about to be a little long read.

I think the biggest career turnover in the data space happens in data science, unfortunately. And by "data science" here, I'm specifically referring to the typical scope of work of a "data scientist", because sometimes the term "data science" can refer to one entire side of the coin of the data space itself, the other side being data management/governance.

Now, talking about turnover, I've seen that it can be hard to break into data science after the learning journey, even harder to succeed in the role, and hardest to sustain success and keep up the progression of career growth. 

Most people give up at Stage 1. Stage 2 is where some others come to the objective realisation that data science isn't the best area for them to make impact with data. Stage 3 is where you see the rest of the pivot where people permanently ditch DS for other data areas such as DA or DE, or even completely outside such as product or engineering.

I've been opportune to function across DA, DS, DE, sometimes focusing on one individual area and other times doing a combination, but I've spent the shortest time doing data engineering and the longest doing data science. In my experience across the 3 areas, it's easy to understand why data science gets the most turnover. Data science is the most hyped amongst all the data specialisations. And, if you ask me the hype is well worth it – data science literally sits at the center of decision optimisation and automation for orgs that are creating and monetising data value streams. 

The problem with this hype is that the complexities are not presented well enough or even at all, so it typically sounds like you only need to learn coding (Python/R), a little bit of statistics, and then machine learning. So you get excited and learn these, then realise that with only these skills, you are just about the most useless DS professional in the competitive talent pool. You even find that your counterparts have additional tools in their stack (e.g., badass SQL, Spark, Kafka, Storm, SageMaker, etc). Now, you have a new motivation, so you throw in more tools to your learning curve.

But all the while you have not learned or developed skills in the deep, intricate principles for driving business value with data science. You have not learned how to extend the capabilities of a data engineer and analyst to get additional business value that those areas alone cannot provide. Note the keyword: *business value*. We will get back to this.

So for those who don't give up in stage 1, they finally get the job and then realise how reality is very off-tangent with expectation. Not everyone is able to adjust to this realisation and adapt at the pace required to keep succeeding in the role, hence the switch to other areas. The ones that are able to adapt and eventually become successful in a data science career are the ones that really had "true" inclinations for the field all along. 

So I think the mistake that has been made over the years when presenting data science to noobs is that people are usually not allowed to naturally discover what their inclinations in the data space are. Rather than trying to hype data science and describe a bunch of skills required for it, a more impactful approach in my experience would be to present different use cases and challenging problems across the data space and initiate discussions to help noobs identify which ones best interest them. 

These discussions would then include details on the kind of tools that are used to solve each type of problem, the skills involved, the problem solving approach, the technical issues or roadblocks that typically arise, and how different resolutions of these issues can impact the business differently. Interestingly, these are the kinds of discussions that come up here a lot, which is why beginners here will benefit a lot.

The more they see different problems and understand which ones belong to which area, the more they begin to develop a pattern of interests and problems they would like to solve; this makes them have the right bias towards a particular area and they are then able to evaluate whether or not they are up for it based on their background or aptitude for learning.

5/14/22, 11:27 PM - Abraham Musa: I think the narrative over here is a bit structured and I think demand for *good data scientist* will continue to be on the rise. Like my team, we currently have five Data Scientist and a single analyst. Apart from myself 😀🤣, the other four guys are core scientist in every sense of it and they build DS products that positively impacts the business everyday. 

The company has massive database and as a new joiner, I'm always surprised that when a new business problem arises, most discussions are geared towards building NNs. Even the graduate level Scientist has been trained to do madass stuffs.
5/14/22, 11:28 PM - Abraham Musa: Doing DS in naija can be very challenging. Even more challenging to build yourself to a world class level cos even the most advanced NG companies haven't really gotten to the point where they think they can leverage or benefit from DS.
5/14/22, 11:30 PM - Abraham Musa: Will I continue to be a DS in the near future? I can't completely say for now but one thing remains, Data Scientist or not, the key thing is to continously solve business problems and deliver value. While at that, good money must be made too.

5/15/22, 12:06 AM - +234 904 894 6475: You nailed it! The ability to drive business value is what keeps one in demand. I was about to extend my earlier post by adding how data scientists can create business value using data science.
5/15/22, 12:18 AM - +234 904 894 6475: For example, in data science, the problems we solve typically revolve around causal inference, machine learning or decision optimisation. Some jobs might focus on only 1 or 2 of these areas. Now, applying any of these 3 scientific pillars to business problems presents us with 2 layers of difficulty. 

One layer is the scientific layer, where the difficulties are mostly around reasoning and problem solving. Reasoning, because the problems (after being formalised in a data science framework) are not always open-ended and you have to draw out the connections and literally create the trajectory for how your solution should evolve. Reasoning requires abstract thought and the ability to deduce things from first principles, and this is one of the most important skills for data science yet the most untapped. Problem solving is another difficulty because you have to be adaptive enough to different solution approaches until you find the most suitable. Also requires you to be persistent enough to push through roadblocks, and alert and objective enough to spot limitations in your methodology and skillfully eliminate them.

Now, the second layer is the business layer, where the difficulty lies with aligning science to business. Science is mostly deterministic, business is mostly stochastic. Applying data science to business then means developing or implementing the specific principles of science that allow us to deal with the "stochastic" nature of a business landscape that is constantly "changing" with new "data". This is why data science is built on solid foundations of calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Notice the 3 things in quotes: stochastic, changing, data. Probability handles the uncertainty (stochasticity), calculus handles the change, linear algebra handles the data. 

Now, as a data scientist, your ability to discover what scientific principles are relevant for a specific business problem is what makes you stand out. This is what I mentioned earlier about being able to drive business value with data. The problem most times with many of us, even the best of us, is that we get so lost or distracted with the techniques and tools for implementing the principles, that we take off our focus from reasoning through the principles and connecting the ideas and methodologies to navigate the business domain until the problem succumbs.

Coding is a very important aspect of our work as data scientists, and the best data scientists I've seen are very excellent at code. But there's usually this notion I've seen about them and that's the fact that coding is always for them a means to an end. The moment the best thing you can do as a data scientist is code, you are not a data scientist, you are a programmer 😂. Harsh statement, but it's the truth, although being a programmer is itself very valuable. 

This is why in robust orgs, the role of machine learning engineer is separated from data scientist role, so an ML engineer focuses on the code-heavy solutions, including system design and integrations, while the data scientist focuses on problem solving, statistical inference, experimentation, ML algorithm justification, and long-term business impact. 

ML engineers who are also very strong on the data-centric and business-centric side are priceless ❤️
5/15/22, 12:25 AM - S+N Ayoade: Abhi 😂 

I don’t have the strength for it.
5/15/22, 12:58 AM - +234 703 160 7868: Solid clarity of thought! This should be a medium post or a YDP blog post. I wanted like it multiple times if possible.
5/15/22, 1:18 AM - +234 813 774 1580: Well said.
5/15/22, 1:24 AM - +234 813 774 1580: Well said, the discussion is always deeper than it seems. In addition to that, its just like back in the days when it was believed that computers will take away bankers jobs but its only going to enhance their effectiveness and evolution. DS and AI can easily be misunderstand in similar fashion.

If one wants to switch career, feel free to do that but don't do it because it is perceived that one is going into extinction. Till this day, the confusion is still there on who a DS is. As the world evolve, DS has grown into a role that requires some part of DE,  ML, and DA; its never just about building models or doing research because if it is then, most of that can be automated. DS will forever revolve around the business impact. While a senior DS may dish out data cleaning to a Junior DS, sometimes I will say that for a new domain where you must learn and understand the business, its better you do that yourself to help you understand the data more because that's where your creativity and curiosity begins and it will aid your discussion with stakeholders.
Amazon  had a lot of open roles in the US for DS in 2022 alone. 
Personally, I'm a crush of both DE, ML, and Data Product Manager. Remember, every data person out there is a product manager. This is not because I think DS is going into extinction but because that's where I love to be for now. @2347038065681 may host a show for us to discuss this😁

I love the way Access Bank planned out this learning track. For those in data science, they paid for 4 Udacity courses. First was Programming for Data Science with Python, then the Data Analyst course, Introduction to Machine Learning, and finally Data Scientist. That's the best scholarship learning track I've seen so far. They did not leave us half-baked. The top students in the first stage were moved to the next.

One of the greatest ways to make impact with data is to treat it as a product, especially on the technical side. On the business side, data needs to be treated as a core business asset. Combine these 2 mindsets about data together, and an org will unleash enormous impact with their data value stream.

5/15/22, 11:17 AM - +234 703 678 8365: For example, when performing EDAs you really wouldn't want to go out of your current work environment(e.g Jupyter notebook) to do visuals with Power BI for every insight you come up with. Libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn as well as python help you with that on the go. A few lines of code can give you an overview Viz of your data rather that several clicks on Tableau and PowerBI. I really wouldn't want to go as far as applying statistical models and checking plots on the go as well.
5/15/22, 11:18 AM - +234 703 678 8365: I'm not a writer like many others, pardon my typo.
5/15/22, 11:26 AM - +234 909 344 4130: 👌🏾
5/15/22, 11:56 AM - +234 706 439 6712: 😁... I love this guy
5/15/22, 11:58 AM - +234 706 439 6712: More reason I prefer python or R for most of my Data analysis...

You get everything done, in one place .
5/15/22, 12:22 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Awesome. This was the response I had in mind after reading the first post.

The tools matter or companies would not make a big deal of it while hiring.
5/15/22, 12:24 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Thank u totally cleared my doubts
5/15/22, 12:25 PM - +234 909 248 3462: So I can decide to generate some insights with python then make my final visualizations on powerbi
5/15/22, 12:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This is sooooo apt. 👌👌👌. Truth is not everyone will be a data scientist and not everybody has to be. There are other roles within the data space one can explore
5/15/22, 12:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Possibly on towards data science.
5/15/22, 12:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: As in 😂😂😂 na so dem bo bo us o.
5/15/22, 12:53 PM - +234 818 047 2075: An interesting question i would like us to answer is this:
How well does DS scale across organisations and industries?

It seems the role of the data analyst and data engineer scales better in terms of use cases than DS.
5/15/22, 12:55 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Local or global ?
5/15/22, 12:55 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Both
5/15/22, 12:56 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Seems some industries/types of companies will benefit from DS far more than some others in terms of use cases
5/15/22, 1:03 PM - +234 903 783 8682: You must have had good exposure from the onset.
5/15/22, 1:23 PM - +234 904 894 6475: <Media omitted>
5/15/22, 1:32 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Mistake at 4:50 - descriptive*, not predictive, modelling

Less data-mature orgs focus on descriptive modelling and are able to realise value with it
5/15/22, 1:54 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks @2349048946475 for this. Very detailed insights. I totally agree that the  data maturity of the company will impact the number of use cases. 

But I also think the industry itself has an impact. For example its easy to identify many DS use cases in financial services company than say a down stream oil and gas company.

I think it is both, industry and data Maturity. Happy to hear your thoughts.
5/15/22, 2:00 PM - +234 818 047 2075: The downstream oil company will likely get more value from employing only a DE and DA than getting a DE, DA and DS. This is what I mean.
5/15/22, 2:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It depends on the Data Maturity of the organization, and in all honesty and what I have seen many organizations will derive more value in just Descriptive/Diagnostic Analytics which can be achieved with the right infrastructure in place (Data Engineer terrain ) and a good Data Analyst exploring the data. 

In Monica Hierachy of needs (AI & Advanced analytics) can only be realized when the pyramid based needs are in place which is where a company have a good data maturity. 

Lastly, I think it also depends on Industry really, most company will at best Data-Driven just leveraging on DA/DE and DS will just be an icing.
5/15/22, 2:14 PM - +234 909 130 5248: DS is something that is done later on
5/15/22, 2:15 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 💪
5/15/22, 2:18 PM - +234 904 894 6475: You are right boss. The industry too matters.

For example, in the downstream sector, one area I can think of where machine learning becomes very useful is supply chain optimisation. Although I've not seen this in practice in 9ja. Other than this, one cannot think of many use cases for DS/ML in that sector.
5/15/22, 2:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 

Thanks @2349048946475 for the detailed response.
5/15/22, 2:22 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Although I think one major problem with the downstream of and gas sector is untapped potential. So the problem is not that there are not many DS use cases that can scale, but that there's not so much tech adoption in several areas. And where the tech is not in place, data science cannot be brought in as a secondary lever.
5/15/22, 2:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data Maturity is very very important and definitely industry. 

Many organizations aren’t matured atleast yet to really support and drive DS use cases and that’s why the right Data Strategy just as @2349048946475 mentioned will also be required which comes with the maturity of the organization. 

I believe we are getting there in Nigeria atleast for organizations who are aware of roles like CDO/Head of Data and all.
5/15/22, 2:25 PM - Abraham Musa: Hmmm. I think in naija it'll still take years sha....
5/15/22, 2:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This one don give up on us 😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/15/22, 2:27 PM - Abraham Musa: Omo. I know wetin I do see sha. The subject of maturity is something organizations aren't ready to talk about actually.
5/15/22, 2:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Sure it will take time to put the right process in place to support a matured Data organization
5/15/22, 2:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And that’s what my company pitch to our client that becoming a Data driven organization is a journey
5/15/22, 2:27 PM - Abraham Musa: Even so called organizations hiring DS lead or the likes.
5/15/22, 2:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I 💯 understand you actually. 

Becoming a Data driven organization is more driven from culture perspectives and not only from the technology side of things of hiring talents and all alone. 

A lot of education need to be done across then organizations actually.
5/15/22, 2:32 PM - +234 904 894 6475: For example, if we begin to see the rise of apps and software products in the downstream sector, such as marketplace apps or apps that manage suppliers and documentation, then first of all we will see a rise of DA/DEs in that sector. 

Then subsequently, data science needs will begin to arise, such as demand forecasting, optimising movement of products, optimising delivery speed, etc. These are use cases that can scale very well.
5/15/22, 2:32 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽
5/15/22, 2:34 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🤣🤣🤣

You no even believe in the people wey dey this room 😂. I believe some folks here are on their journey to becoming CEOs and transforming how we do data in 9ja 🤲🏽
5/15/22, 2:36 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Hmmmm
5/15/22, 2:37 PM - Abraham Musa: Not like that actually boss. The truth is years from now many of the experts here won't be working for any NG company. That's just the sad truth.
5/15/22, 2:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😭😭😭😭😭🥰🥰
5/15/22, 2:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Sad truth actually.
5/15/22, 2:37 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes, I'm also seeing the emergence of data science executive leadership in Nigeria. Orgs that leverage this capability well will lead the change
5/15/22, 2:37 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🥲
5/15/22, 2:38 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The market is now a global one 😭😭😭😭
5/15/22, 2:39 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
5/15/22, 2:40 PM - Abraham Musa: Hmmmm.
5/15/22, 2:40 PM - +234 904 894 6475: That's true sha
5/15/22, 2:40 PM - Abraham Musa: Not with the global market boss. Really not trying to counter you oo but
5/15/22, 2:41 PM - +234 904 894 6475: You are really trying to be objective 😂
5/15/22, 2:41 PM - Abraham Musa: Today, even a junior DS is eyeing global roles already. Seniors eyeing global roles. So, I ask myself most times what's the future in NG we always talk about?
5/15/22, 2:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The way you ditched the company you wanted to help build their Data culture for FX 😂😂
5/15/22, 2:42 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Very sad indeed..


What do you expect from a  ' toxic ' economic atmosphere,
5/15/22, 2:42 PM - Abraham Musa: Omo. E be things sha.
5/15/22, 2:42 PM - Abraham Musa: I feel like there's going to be a global wave of talent import from Naija sha.
5/15/22, 2:43 PM - Abraham Musa: Not the type where people will work globally and still be in Naija ooo
5/15/22, 2:43 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌👌
5/15/22, 2:43 PM - Abraham Musa: Massive relocation period and window. Very very very soon for good data professionals. Only time will tell sha.
5/15/22, 2:44 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hmm this is also another angle actually 👌
5/15/22, 2:45 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Na why him japa 😂😂😂
5/15/22, 2:45 PM - Abraham Musa: @2348108522573 make I ask you one funny question ooo
5/15/22, 2:46 PM - Abraham Musa: Shea you dey build your skills and gather momentum to become CDO for Naija company in the near future? 😀😀😀😀🤣🤣🤣
5/15/22, 2:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Very sad honestly...

Adoption is an issue and they behave soo traditional 🥲
5/15/22, 2:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I really like this chief. 👌. Very true
5/15/22, 2:47 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No place like home like Iyin said 😂😂😂

I fit decide to come back 9ja to come make some impact 😂😂
5/15/22, 2:47 PM - Abraham Musa: Even @2348180472075 . I sincerely believe one company will come hijack you very very soon
5/15/22, 2:48 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I don't o. Infact I fear for the space. With remote options getting easily accessible, there may end up being a talent crunch especially for middle to senior level talent.
5/15/22, 2:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For now let’s go secure the bag outside then come back and make impact 😂

And I don’t know sha we follow God’s leading. If baba God say make we reside here we obey 😃
5/15/22, 2:48 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌exactly my point
5/15/22, 2:49 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 😂😂😂 he say hijack. Pls they should come o. I don't mind 😂😂
5/15/22, 2:49 PM - Abraham Musa: 😀😀😀😀😀😀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5/15/22, 2:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But I get your point actually. 

The talent massive exodus will really threaten data maturity of an organization, and that’s why I believe the smart ones will build a good pipeline and be ready to pay heavily for the available Lead Data talents to help them.
5/15/22, 2:50 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Very true sha. We follow God's leading. Let's see how it goes
5/15/22, 2:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
5/15/22, 2:51 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This is the best thing. I think internships and NYSC have been underrated and tbh that is a very good way to build talent pipelines
5/15/22, 2:52 PM - Abraham Musa: This is actually interesting one oooo. I hardly see people God lead to relocate, spend years working for global brands and come back to start building something in Naija. Just check LinkedIn and do some survey.
5/15/22, 2:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I used to be close to senior folks in that sector. The reason many of them would resist tech adoption is because they profit from the loopholes and inefficiencies in the sector. If you want to know what free lunch looks like, come downstream 🤣
5/15/22, 2:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🤲🏽🤲🏽🤲🏽
5/15/22, 2:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️
5/15/22, 2:54 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. I also agree with this in a way. The question from me always is that how long will guys in the pipeline serve loyalty? I think the hussle today cuts across interns, junior, seniors and even managers in Naija oo.
5/15/22, 2:54 PM - +234 904 894 6475: A time will come when serious data-driven orgs in Nigeria will see the need to pay heavily, at the international rate, to retain talent.
5/15/22, 2:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 

Middle & Senior is where the challenge is actually.
5/15/22, 2:54 PM - +234 706 439 6712: _How of us are actually pinned and deliberate about  solving Nigerian 's problems using Data/I.T skills or we are largely , simply just  chasing the bag_?  🧐

Can Innovation thrive hence?
5/15/22, 2:55 PM - +234 818 047 2075: The thing about catching them young is you probably still have them for 2 to 3 years post NYSC
5/15/22, 2:55 PM - +234 909 130 5248: Let the bag come first then we think about solving problems
5/15/22, 2:55 PM - Abraham Musa: I'm surprised sometimes you see a fresh out from school getting job with global brands like Microsoft, Google etc. Ifs really war
5/15/22, 2:55 PM - +234 909 130 5248: No problem solver solve problems on hunger
5/15/22, 2:56 PM - +234 706 439 6712: 🤣...  I like ur honesty
5/15/22, 2:56 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly the point
5/15/22, 2:56 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I think that’s what Interswitch is trying to do now with their new program. 

Catch them going to retain them 2-3 years
5/15/22, 2:56 PM - Abraham Musa: Tbh,  I would argue that most of us are chasing the bag boss.
5/15/22, 2:56 PM - +234 904 894 6475: <Media omitted>
5/15/22, 3:00 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Exactly. What will even be better is to try to train them from say 200L. Imagine a 200L student joining YDP today. By final year, the guy probably has a good grasp of the space and can deliver projects. So his NYSC, he isn't coming in as a fresher but experienced.
5/15/22, 3:01 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This isn't such a bad thing because it is then easier to fund initiatives that are solving the real problems.
5/15/22, 3:02 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly. 

And my worry is that , even when we get the bag and things begin to a get bit "rosy " , we get distracted and end up not solving those problems we initially obliged to.
5/15/22, 3:02 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This talent issue will force our companies to think more creatively and probably work more closely with universities and that's something we have always wanted
5/15/22, 3:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It requires investment which may not yield immediate profit 😂. 

How many companies are ready to do that to build such pipelines? That’s where the challenge is really. 

Many organizations want talents to come and hit the ground running and start churning out value and increase revenue. The global talent war will help organizations think creatively now really.
5/15/22, 3:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: There are exceptions oo
5/15/22, 3:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: There are exceptions oo

Hungry exceptions
5/15/22, 3:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: There will always be exceptions no doubt.
5/15/22, 3:04 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Imagine someone you catch young who finds his way to this group chat and hears some folks are collecting 4K to 8K on this group
5/15/22, 3:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But you can rely on the pool of talents and make decision on that most will stay 2-3 atleast unlike getting Mid/Senior that will leave anytime if the FX show
5/15/22, 3:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Microsoft is doing this using the cloud advocates
5/15/22, 3:06 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Well Octave Analytics to me has the best Talent Pool so far when it comes to Data science . 

That my Oga Blessing is the Monaco and a arsenal of data science in Nigeria
5/15/22, 3:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Many Mid/Senior 9ja talent I can say with my full chest are just waiting for the FX to show 😂😂😂
5/15/22, 3:06 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂🤣
5/15/22, 3:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The ones still waiting na equity dey make them stay
5/15/22, 3:07 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Which is also another option companies can use to retain their talents
5/15/22, 3:08 PM - +234 706 439 6712: With good strategy, workable system and deliberate commitment to make it work , it will work , Boss.    I strongly believe it.
5/15/22, 3:52 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Is it advisable to learn data science and data Engineering concurrently?
5/15/22, 3:52 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Ahh
5/15/22, 3:53 PM - +234 909 248 3462: I got a one in a life time opportunity to learn those courses and it's hard 4 me to drop one
5/15/22, 3:53 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Any advise?
5/15/22, 3:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What God cannot do doesn’t exist.
5/15/22, 3:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Better pick one and leave one.
5/15/22, 3:54 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Thank u sir
5/15/22, 3:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Else you will learn both concurrently and won’t know any 💀
5/15/22, 3:57 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Noted
5/15/22, 3:58 PM - +234 905 939 2803: You sha can dash me one🌚
5/15/22, 3:58 PM - +234 909 248 3462: 😂
5/15/22, 3:59 PM - +234 909 248 3462: I wish
5/15/22, 4:06 PM - +234 813 774 1580: Pick the one you love the most and later, you can do a career switch if you want to.
Also sometimes guys start with DS then transition into DE, you may choose to follow their footsteps if its convenient for you. Anyhow it appears to be, no choke yourself because concurrent learning is never a good idea in data space or in general.
5/15/22, 4:06 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Thank you sir
5/15/22, 4:07 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Was already feeling overwhelmed
5/15/22, 4:08 PM - +234 816 398 2854: No choke yourself

5/15/22, 4:33 PM - +234 706 439 6712: *Funny confession*

I chose Data Engineering path because I have always fantasied studying  engineering, all my life but couldn't , instead ,I was offered statistics finished among tops in my department, But still wants engineering. Like "Engineering"  is the most romantic word  I have ever be came across, in my life.

In 2017, I Won a mini - scholarship to represent my school in a Big data training, chaired by Computer science professor from Stanford University.There and then , my interest in Data *Engineering* came to live . been grinding , ever since.




At least if I do Electrical or petroleum Engineering like I always wanted, I go be successful Data *Engineer* n even earn higher than those guys 😁

5/15/22, 9:36 PM - Joe: My view on this

I don't consider the take home assessment to be hard.

btw I'm not an Oga neither have I been involved in hiring before. 

Can I send my attempt to your DM sometime tomorrow 😁
5/15/22, 9:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Sure Man
5/15/22, 9:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Feel Free
5/15/22, 9:37 PM - +234 803 916 0301: This message was deleted
5/15/22, 9:40 PM - +234 708 531 6273: It is actually nice. Not flattering you but this is a wonderful DE take home.

How do you guys plan to catch those that didn't do it by themselves?
5/15/22, 9:43 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂

Because I would still end up interviewing you on it
5/15/22, 9:44 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And also no one would do an end to end project for you for free 😅
5/15/22, 9:45 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Ok. Good. I like that kind of setup.
5/15/22, 9:46 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Apparently one guy did everything here with Azure services
5/15/22, 9:46 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Well, for a very good job, one wouldn't mind paying to get it done.
5/15/22, 9:47 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I know right 
But how would you survive afterwards
5/15/22, 9:49 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Using cloud services is actually one's best bet. At least you will escape any possible infrastructure set up question 😅. Only Airflow will just be the open-source
5/15/22, 9:49 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Move to another job after collecting 3 months salary 😅
5/15/22, 9:50 PM - +234 816 484 7452: <Media omitted>
5/15/22, 9:50 PM - Joe: Exactly
5/15/22, 9:51 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But you know the reality of things

Everyone got the assessment after first round interview, after all
The promises they made and what they could do with regards to DE

But only a few were able to submit an attempt
5/15/22, 9:53 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Everything can also be done with open source and some VM setup
5/15/22, 9:54 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Acknowledged boss 🙏
5/15/22, 9:57 PM - S+N Ayoade: Best sha to show technicality and knowledge of open source tool 

I wan go read for my exam 😂
5/15/22, 10:00 PM - +234 814 669 0593: It differs by job specifications and focus of the company . 


But let me share some.....

- You have been collecting data about how often customers abandon shopping carts, over the last hour, and you have concluded that on average one customer abandons their cart per minute. In the next minute, 5 customers abandon their cart. What do you think now?

- What are the compute performance implications of LSTM vs Transformer?

- Historically what developments have allowed computer vision to make use of very deep networks?

- You have been training an artificial neural network using a completely basic gradient descent training loop, and its performance has converged to 80% accuracy. What could you try now to increase the accuracy?

- Explain geometrically, what is the relationship between dot product and cosine similarity. What is the relationship between matrix transpose and inverse?

-  What differentiates L1 and L2 penalty and what are their implications 

- What are the importances of Linear and Non linear kernels in SVM 

- Your company intends to develop a model for predicting future price of goods. The lead analyst suggests using tree based models.  What will be your recommendation on the suggestion.


My hand hurts 😫
5/15/22, 10:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Omooooooooooo 1million X
5/15/22, 10:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: How many DS here can answer these things now 😅

That’s true.. you can direct your queries to him
5/15/22, 10:08 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
This captures several DS interview case problems
5/15/22, 10:08 PM - +234 816 484 7452: So we got DA, DS and DE assessment question in one night.

Look at your niche and access yourself 😅
5/15/22, 10:15 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Wawuuu
5/15/22, 10:15 PM - +234 703 954 3297: Can you please tag the DA assessment
5/15/22, 10:16 PM - +234 812 216 8133: +1
5/15/22, 10:18 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Didn't see DA assessment
5/15/22, 10:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Oh

5/16/22, 4:31 PM - Condil: Maybe this might help you. I use to read wide on each of the commands. Then repeat severally. So when I run into errors, I'm able to trace the source. I'm still on the first video though
5/16/22, 4:32 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I've already abandoned the course.

5/16/22, 4:36 PM - +234 903 783 8682: The instructor just copies and pastes code without explaining why he's doing it and what each line is supposed to do.

They said the course assumes no prior knowledge of docker and it's supporting tools but it seems the instructor has forgotten.

5/16/22, 4:50 PM - +234 813 556 4853: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

This same thing happened to me... I just abandoned the course and started data Engineering career track course on datacamp....
5/16/22, 4:51 PM - Condil: Datacamp that completes half of the code for you?
5/16/22, 4:53 PM - +234 703 786 9165: I disagree on this one. I'd only agree if you want a course that spoon feeds you and if that's what you want, check out DataCamp. 

I started this today and yes I spent some time figuring things out but I got it figured out and my docker is working and I can see madass use of even the local version of docker already. 

I think y'all need to be ready to do some research yourself and if you're not ready, stick with DataCamp.
5/16/22, 4:54 PM - +234 703 786 9165: The guy also didn't copy and paste codes so far from what I've seen. I think you need to be ready to use your googling skills Fam.
5/16/22, 4:54 PM - Condil: 💖
5/16/22, 4:55 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Also, do you know that you need to change directories to the folder that you have your docker file in?
5/16/22, 4:55 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Did you change directory? Or you assumed that the command line will know which directory you're working in and run the docker file in that directory instead?
5/16/22, 4:56 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Today is my first time on docker!
5/16/22, 4:57 PM - +234 813 556 4853: Yea... But d videos are very explanatory... I watch and practice on my own.... It has been helping me 😉😉😉
5/16/22, 4:57 PM - +234 703 786 9165: The only thing for me is that the guys vocal energy is low... He dey make me want sleep sometimes.

Two days after, TheGuardian published a lite version of it.

Today, I explored the data using the Pandas and seaborn libraries in Python.

@2348108522573, I guess I told you the reason why I voluntarily pulled out of the kiddies coding program we launched fully in 2020?

It's about a year since I pulled out now, and I'm glad that I did that very early.

5/17/22, 9:31 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Nice. Will probably just do same. Do you have vendors you are considering?
5/17/22, 9:32 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Some of the so-called tech blogs are paid to publish the interests of the "company" they're posting about. And it's really saddening.

While we haven't yet trained 200 kids, bloggers were paid to publish that over 2k kids have been trained.
5/17/22, 9:32 AM - +234 706 439 6712: No I haven't.. I actually don't have access to the it, at the moment. Someone dropped the assessment, in another group am in last week... Might have to check with the person
5/17/22, 9:33 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Exactly, It will never last. The rush and craze for fame is getting crazy honestly. People do all sorts for clout and money. Sighs 😕

5/17/22, 9:33 AM - +234 810 831 6393: The day I saw the blogs, I challenged the dude in charge of our marketing, baba said it's a marketing strategy. Omo I dropped my withdrawal mail and walked away peacefully.
5/17/22, 9:33 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Alright then.

5/17/22, 9:34 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I might be wrong though, but sometimes those VCs gave money based on some recommendations, and not due diligence
5/17/22, 9:35 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Baba , check ur dm , plz.
5/17/22, 9:35 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Yeah, I'm sorry I dragged you into the program then.

5/17/22, 9:37 AM - +234 810 831 6393: You see say Olympus don fall now, when last did you hear about the program?

5/17/22, 9:37 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Set?
5/17/22, 9:38 AM - +234 909 130 5248: I don’t even want to hear
5/17/22, 9:38 AM - +234 909 130 5248: In what context??
5/17/22, 9:38 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Cardinally in sets refers to the number of elements in a *set*
5/17/22, 9:38 AM - +234 705 234 8519: Data Visualization

5/17/22, 9:44 AM - +234 703 845 5619: But then in this context, I don't think there are up to 10 orgs that are truthful with what they put on the media. Including banks, oil and gas as well including government.

Everyone literally manipulates the numbers for the media... 

Most of the what is on the media (social and traditional) is exaggerated fact.

5/17/22, 9:48 AM - +234 810 831 6393: You're an ed-tech company trying to train kids, but the foundation is wrong.
@2349091305248 is a witness to a lot of problems I was trying to solve internally before the bloggers were being paid to mislead the public with their publication

I'm hearing some weirdness about our favourite Fintech. 

I've always made it clear that I am not a fan of Fintech apps offering savings and investment opportunities for three reasons:

1. What are you investing in that's generating that level of return?
2. How sustainable is it? 
3. They're one policy away from shutting down.

Then there's the question of regulation... 


That said, there was some rumours in the past about the app with an animal's name owing customers. They quickly made a press release to debunk it. 

But I maintain there's no fire without smoke somewhere. 

So, my advise is, if you have money there, please move it to a financial institution with proper regulations for now. 

Our CBN governor is too busy pursuing presidency to worry about the state of financial institutions in Nigeria. 

SEC isn't sure of it's jurisdiction, nor have they proven to have the capacity to deal with New Age Fintech. 

Clearly we are yet dealing with the case of "too small to bother" when it comes to this issue... and it will remain so until they become too big to ignore. 

But I foresee a change eventually. How soon and which way it will swing is yet to be seen. 

High interest rates are great. But don't gamble too much in the name of saving outside a regulated institution. 

✌🏽
5/17/22, 11:26 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Meanwhile I'm building my website.

5/17/22, 11:28 AM - +234 703 047 1536: I think it is 🐷🦺
5/17/22, 11:30 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Good question.
5/17/22, 11:30 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2347038065681 hatred for Fintech I don’t know why 😂😂
5/17/22, 11:30 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Good answer

5/17/22, 11:32 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know 

We’ve had conversations so I know her reasons are legitimate and valid.
5/17/22, 11:32 AM - +234 703 806 5681: It's not hate o.

Na healthy skepticism.

My job is to audit everything from the view of both business and the investor.

If I can't give a wholistic advise wetin come be my job 😂
5/17/22, 11:33 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That your role for Deloitte in all honesty fit you die and help you in all spheres 😂😂😂
5/17/22, 11:34 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks so much @2347038065681
5/17/22, 11:34 AM - +234 909 130 5248: All fintechs are the same fr, they do nothing to solve problems, just vibes and PR
5/17/22, 11:35 AM - +234 818 047 2075: I dey accept customers o. 😏. We are sec regulated 😁
5/17/22, 11:35 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For Savings sha I trust and understand Cowrywise model which is reliable and very understanding. They also have a trustee structure (they were the first to have that). So I no dey fear. 

If there is anyone I will consider moving my money away I know that one which I will do that soon 

Thanks for the nudge
5/17/22, 11:35 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *Savings/Investment
5/17/22, 11:36 AM - +234 909 130 5248: I’ll probably not save in either of them fr, most are just recycling models and rebuilding UIs
5/17/22, 11:36 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Well that’s your opinion.
5/17/22, 11:37 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I use Cowrywise for my savings and their investment ROI isn’t ridiculous and you can do your DD also.
5/17/22, 11:37 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Yeah if there's a trustee, that's fine.

If there isn't, omo shift
5/17/22, 11:37 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Exactly.
5/17/22, 11:37 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s why I said thanks for the nudge
5/17/22, 11:37 AM - +234 817 965 1769: omoh which app ooo
5/17/22, 11:37 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And I know the one I will evacuate my money from
5/17/22, 11:38 AM - +234 909 130 5248: My opinion is that most mainstream banks now do what these guys do and even better. I’m not saying Fintechs are bad, yes they solve some problems like seamless transactions which is what most people want, apart from that, they are very vulnerable to policies
5/17/22, 11:38 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Kuda chop my eye last year, I carry matter go report for CBN, maybe CBN go take serious action(s) on the matter tomorrow. The duos of @FCMB et @KUDAMFB are a no go area for me.
5/17/22, 11:38 AM - +234 803 895 5227: These has been my reasons. I remember communicating thus same thing to @2348108316393. I don't use any fintech app and will never it until I see a reasonable reason
5/17/22, 11:38 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I no dey mention name. 

They may be my next employer 😂

5/17/22, 11:40 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Any time I remembered the Kuda case, I can't stop imagining how failed a country is, and how rotten the banking sector is
5/17/22, 11:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And your money also devaluate. 

Onyeka that put that up also understand you can’t just put your money in the bank that’s not a smart wealth management technique.
5/17/22, 11:41 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So if you think you are playing safe for dumping your bank to just sit with GTB then that’s interesting 😂😂

5/17/22, 11:41 AM - +234 810 831 6393: As my uncle (a retired senior man at CBN) will say, those MFBs claiming fintech as yahoo yahoo ventures
5/17/22, 11:42 AM - +234 909 130 5248: I believe you can save FX with them too. I’ve not really dived into the workings of these banks but Fintechs aren’t doing anything better for me
5/17/22, 11:42 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Not a smart move at all
5/17/22, 11:42 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Are *~as~*
5/17/22, 11:43 AM - +234 703 806 5681: 😂😂
They start as Fintech, then buy a failing mfb to rebrand it

But their activities aren't in line with what MFB were created for.
5/17/22, 11:43 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I tell you
5/17/22, 11:44 AM - +234 803 895 5227: There are many ways you can invest and thanks to @2347038065681 for enlightening us so far. But investing with fintech is not just the best idea for me
5/17/22, 11:44 AM - +234 810 831 6393: He calm down de lecture me about the difference btw the real MFBs (they're not safe to put much money into either), and the Yahoo ventures parading as Fintechs
5/17/22, 11:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You most likely can’t do without them in honesty 😂.  They democratize access to some asset class for you which is why you should do your DD, and the fact that there are shaky options doesn’t mean all are bad.
5/17/22, 11:45 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Even SEC regulated asset managers have trustees.

ARM has one with an entity that isn't them.

So does Stanbic, Cordros and most others.

The trustee manages the fund.

This creates some transparency to their activities
5/17/22, 11:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Summary do your DD well and also know LIFE is a risk 😂. 

“Who never fuck up hands in the air “
5/17/22, 11:46 AM - +234 803 895 5227: Can't do without them like how?

5/17/22, 5:52 PM - +234 703 806 5681: But I like the ease of wix. Plus if I need to add other stuff to the site, it's straight forward.

My experience with wp and one million plug-ins were exhausting tbh.

Even integrated mailchimp then and earned myself a pair of their socks from Denmark 😂

I'd rather deal with a platform that handles the nitty gritty work while I focus on what I want the site to contain and do for me.

Wo, Website na just vibes for Naija..

5/17/22, 5:59 PM - S+N Ayoade: 😂
5/17/22, 5:59 PM - S+N Ayoade: Somebody was like I should have downloaded their website when I know it will expire soon.

2. I took their coding challenge a few weeks ago. It was too easy for me. Personally, I don't think I'm so good to the extent of breezing through a coding challenge. Could it be that they deliberately made the challenge easy or I'm actually better than I think. I'll go for the former.

3. You should have at least 2 years experience in whatever stack you're applying for.

4. Don't take them too serious.

5/17/22, 9:48 PM - +234 909 130 5248: Depending on the role, it’s quite difficult and they ask relevant questions, not just any coding challenge
5/17/22, 9:48 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Do they ask graph algorithms?

Quite urgent

Thank  you
5/18/22, 9:41 AM - +234 808 589 7009: Hi guys,
Has anyone here used redash? 
And would you recommend this over Tableau? 

If you have used both, do you recommend any over the other and why?

cc: @2348108522573 @2348180472075
5/18/22, 9:41 AM - +234 818 227 7125: Congratulations @2348108316393
5/18/22, 9:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Red ash have a lot of wahala oo
5/18/22, 9:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Currently helping a client migrate from Redash 💀💀
5/18/22, 9:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Tableau & Redash comparison will be difficult they kind of serve same purpose though different. 

Tableau - Great aesthetics and all but uses memory because you have import the data into the BI and also do modeling in that same layer which is also similar to Power BI. 

Redash on the hand is an SQL based viz tool but might be difficult to maintain too as the data scale if you don’t have a separate transformation/modeling layer
5/18/22, 9:46 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: To recommend what’s your current stack your BI layer will be consuming from?
5/18/22, 9:52 AM - +234 808 589 7009: Thanks man. 
Yeah, make sense. Only heard of redash today as someone was recommending this over tableau that i recommended.

Using DBT to do transformation and modelling on redshift.
5/18/22, 9:53 AM - +234 814 833 4339: Hows the two compared to Apache Superset?
5/18/22, 9:53 AM - +234 814 833 4339: Does anyone have any idea?
5/18/22, 9:53 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Oh, cool you are implementing MDS
5/18/22, 9:53 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: In that case since you are using dbt as your layer you can check out Metabase or Superset
5/18/22, 9:54 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I think will fit much better in that stack. So your downstream user can the data and report they just need.
5/18/22, 9:55 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And if your downstream stakeholders will need aesthetic reports then maybe you want to integrate Tableau/Power BI, but I doubt you want to integrate multiple BI layer at this stage
5/18/22, 9:55 AM - +234 803 353 6901: dbt*
5/18/22, 9:56 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Thank you 😂😂😂
5/18/22, 9:56 AM - +234 808 589 7009: 😂😂😂😂
5/18/22, 9:57 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Superset is also an family of SQL based viz tool, however it’s similar to Looker & Lightdash because it also help you treat your report and dashboard as a code.
5/18/22, 9:58 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This feature of treating report and dashboard as a code with version control and all is what others don’t have yet.  So you can explore Superset/Metabase/Lightdash and finalize which one works.
5/18/22, 9:59 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They are all open source viz tool, so if your goal is to help your organization minimize cost and yet get the best you can go the open source route.
5/18/22, 10:07 AM - +234 808 589 7009: Thanks @2348108522573  🙏

Not been a fan of Metabase although I understand where Metabase shines especially if you are using a MDS and trying to improve data access and democratization in your organization. 
I will probably just do some more research here. Thanks for your input, really valuable🙌
5/18/22, 10:11 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Anytime bro. 

All the tools have their prons & cons and where they are best suited for, so to help your decision determine your downstream user ( Are they technical folks or non-technical and how will they consume it?). That knowledge will help you decide the optimal tool that fit that use case.

5/18/22, 12:45 PM - +234 810 831 6393: @2348065935396 et other guys working with insurance companies, I have a question to ask ó.

Is *claims ratio* calculated flatly across the entirely earnings and disbursements of the fiscal year, or it varies according to the type of insurance policy different class of holders are subscribed to?
5/18/22, 12:46 PM - +234 706 632 1212: Check https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS  @2348122168133
5/18/22, 12:47 PM - +234 810 831 6393: *Entire ~entirely~*
5/18/22, 12:49 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks
5/18/22, 12:51 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Can someone recommend a good book/article on the applications of big data to the insurance companies (probably with a focus on Telematics)
5/18/22, 12:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnnn... It depends on the company tho.

Claims ratio can be calculated per customer portfolio, or per insurance class/product.

But the major thing is the more the claims the higher the ratio.

Ideally, it should be per customer portfolio, i.e. taking all the insurance products that the customer uses into account.

@2348180472075, @2348141921557, @2348039160301 can add to this.
5/18/22, 12:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: @2348039160301, has built some DS projects in Insurance.
@2348141921557 worked on some Insurance projects.

5/18/22, 1:06 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Thanks a bunch boss 🙏
5/18/22, 1:10 PM - +234 810 321 0794: It can done per class and holistically. Per class, you’ll do this to know the rate at which the losses occur under each classes of insurance you do and enable you determine the high risks. Holistically will enable you know how the rate of claims you have per year in comparison to previous years.
5/18/22, 1:14 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Thanks for this information.

In our use case, we're more concerned about the *cars section* of the insurance companies. i.e., the section dealing with policy holders who insures their vehicles with the respective insurance providers.
5/18/22, 1:15 PM - +234 810 831 6393: We've built a driver scorecard system that scores and ranks a driver regarding his driving behavior over a defined period of time, taking a number of metrics into consideration.
5/18/22, 1:16 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Oh awesome
5/18/22, 1:16 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Good afternoon all. @2347038065681 please can I send a DM? I need your advice on something.
5/18/22, 1:16 PM - +234 810 831 6393: We also have the anti-loss system which helps determine (to a large extent) who is guilty or innocent in the case of an accident, by factoring many metrics as well
5/18/22, 1:17 PM - +234 810 831 6393: We're into telematics in my company, but we're not just a conventional car tracking company.
5/18/22, 1:18 PM - +234 810 831 6393: During the course of a stakeholders meeting with a potential client some times last week, the question was asked about how our system would help improve claims ratio for insurance companies
5/18/22, 1:19 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Bearing in mind that policy holders must also be protected
5/18/22, 1:19 PM - +234 810 831 6393: *The interests of policy holders*
5/18/22, 1:19 PM - +234 810 321 0794: I think the claims ratio should be per client in respect to their age brackets
5/18/22, 1:21 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Old drivers tend to drive carefully than young people and would have lesser claims   💀
5/18/22, 1:23 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hmm I don't work in Insurance currently o but I have some insurance experience. I think it should be based on Policy and not at a customer level. You can have a customer with a high motor policy claims ratio cause of bad roads and security of where he lives but may have a lower ratio for other insurance policies.
5/18/22, 1:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: pls listen to the expert 👆
5/18/22, 1:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Omo is this a naija company? 👍
5/18/22, 1:25 PM - +234 810 831 6393: This exactly is my stance as well. Cos I believe that the severity of claims per holder also needs to factored in the claims ratio
5/18/22, 1:25 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Yeah, we're a startup though

5/18/22, 1:30 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, at least I know of one InsurTech in Nigeria.

Octamile.
5/18/22, 1:31 PM - +234 810 321 0794: In order to underwrite a motor insurance, these factors should be considered in respect to claims; 

Age
Health status (is the driver an alcoholic)
Location (bad road) 
Vehicle etc.

So you can do claim ratio under these three factors but I think age is the grand factor.
5/18/22, 1:32 PM - +234 810 321 0794: You’re welcome
5/18/22, 1:33 PM - +234 810 831 6393: We're not an insurance company, but we are serving them (one at this time), we're in talks with another one sha
5/18/22, 1:35 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Ok great

5/18/22, 1:52 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Pls, I need past questions for AWS cloud practitioner exam🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
5/18/22, 1:53 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So I can tell you from my experience (and what my model has pointed out to me) that age really might not be a good parameter. From our pilot phase, when we subjected the collected data to modeling, we that the most risky driver was an old man, the 2nd most risky was a young fellow, 3rd was also an old man.

About the same thing played out in the category of safe drivers.
5/18/22, 1:55 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Now coming to practical explanations, for those who have lived in kwara before and knows Unilorin very well, my old man (dad) has on several occasions driven all the way from Ganmo to Unilorin under 15 minutes, which is one of the most dangerous things I think anyone would want to do
5/18/22, 1:55 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I have cousins who are wierd drivers as well
5/18/22, 1:56 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I used to be an ajala traveler before I stopped that earlier this year when the roads were becoming more unsafe
5/18/22, 1:57 PM - +234 810 321 0794: This is why it is a ratio. You’re definitely looking at a large number of people and there’ll definitely be exceptions. Out of 100 old people, less than 30 will be crazy drivers and over 50 young drivers will pose as a high risk on a scale of 1-100
5/18/22, 1:57 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So trying to say younger people drive in risky manners, while the older ones drive in a safe manner might be untrue in all cases (using the Nigerian scenario)
5/18/22, 1:58 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Well you may be right, the pilot phase consists of 89 drivers, but the final model was built on 74 drivers who met the set standards for our modeling
5/18/22, 1:59 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Oh interesting
5/18/22, 1:59 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Probably when we have a larger number, we can get more clarity
5/18/22, 2:00 PM - +234 810 321 0794: For clarity, it’s not just old and young. It’s a range like 

18-25
26-35
36-45 etc
5/18/22, 2:01 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So a major concern now is that with our systems, we are able to rank a driver as either being a safe driver, or a risky driver.

How do you think this affects the decision of insurance companies in awarding claims to policy holders?
5/18/22, 2:02 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Then with our anti-loss system, we are also able (to a large extent) to determine the guilty or innocent driver in the case of an accident
5/18/22, 2:02 PM - +234 810 831 6393: How can these be factored into the claims ratio
5/18/22, 2:04 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Or better put, in this first scenario, what's the conventional way of dealing with such issues?
5/18/22, 2:04 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Okay, so those that are known as high risk can be charged excess of loss. 

By excess of loss, you’ll pay part of your claims yourself by a particular percentage, say 30%

So, if you have a claim of 100k, you’ll pay 30k and insurance will pay 70k. This will enable you take necessary precautions
5/18/22, 2:04 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I know (read) that insurance companies do carry out researches before they award claims to holders.
5/18/22, 2:05 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 📌
5/18/22, 2:06 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Ok
5/18/22, 2:06 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So regarding this, let's say a particular driver has come with claims more than once, does this also affect the amount he will be awarded for subsequent claims?
5/18/22, 2:07 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Yes, his premiums will also increase
5/18/22, 2:10 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Awesome 🥰
5/18/22, 2:11 PM - +234 810 831 6393: So do you think our system will help insurance companies improve their claim ratios, while also protecting the interests of policy holders?
5/18/22, 2:12 PM - +234 810 831 6393: We're routing for UBI such that if as a policy holder, I don't come for a claim this year, then by next year, I should get some discounts in my premium
5/18/22, 2:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: It's still InsurTech to me. There are a number of them around the world.
5/18/22, 2:13 PM - +234 810 831 6393: @2348108522573 biko check your DM 🙏
5/18/22, 2:14 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Yeah I get, I'm only trying to clarify that the *tech* is what we do at our end, while leave the *Insur* to the insurance companies.

🤠🤠
5/18/22, 2:17 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Yes, this happens. There’s a name for it. No claim discount or so
5/18/22, 2:18 PM - +234 810 321 0794: No claim bonus
5/18/22, 2:18 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I guess a number of policyholders are not aware of this 🤔
5/18/22, 2:18 PM - +234 810 321 0794: Yes😂 they don’t
5/18/22, 2:19 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Insurance companies cashing out steadily on policyholders ignorance 😂😅
5/18/22, 2:19 PM - +234 810 321 0794: But insurance companies usually reduce the premium rate for these kind of loyal policyholders
5/18/22, 2:19 PM - +234 810 321 0794: 💀
5/18/22, 2:20 PM - +234 810 321 0794: One massive claim can clear all the cash outs tho🌚
5/18/22, 2:20 PM - +234 703 160 7868: I'm so enjoying this discuss😄. Learnt some really cool things about insurance today. Thank you oo🤲🏼

5/18/22, 2:24 PM - +234 810 321 0794: You’re welcome Guru😁
5/18/22, 2:25 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Hope he doesn't throw a question that will throw me off balance at me 🥺😂
5/18/22, 2:25 PM - +234 810 321 0794: You can do it 💪🏾
5/18/22, 2:26 PM - +234 810 831 6393: But I gat you as a backup sha. I'll ask to use a life line and it'll be *phone a friend* 😂😅
5/18/22, 2:27 PM - +234 810 321 0794: 🤣
5/18/22, 2:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You'll say, "that's an interesting question" 🤔
5/18/22, 2:29 PM - +234 818 415 3106: then end with "can i look into it"

5/18/22, 2:39 PM - +234 703 806 5681: What's OT?
5/18/22, 2:57 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Scope in street language
5/18/22, 3:11 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Ok
5/18/22, 3:14 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Street slang for wisdom
5/18/22, 3:23 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Another meaning @2347038065681
5/18/22, 3:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: dbt Labs are building support for Python models. 

@2347085316273 rememeber when I said the product that will give dbt a  chase will really do a mad work. Those guys have hacked the MDS and strategically positioning themselves as a force 😂. 

Na to dey run combo of SQL/Python for data models.
5/18/22, 3:25 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Bikonu 🙏 check your DM 🙏
5/18/22, 3:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Sadly that will mean Python will now be a necessity kinda for AEs
5/18/22, 3:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Okay
5/18/22, 3:28 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Niceeee. 
I love python!! 

These days only proactive companies will rule for long. I knew it was only a matter of time before python starts crawling into the MDS space. Good to know DBT lab is the one taking the bold step.
5/18/22, 3:28 PM - +234 708 531 6273: <Media omitted>
5/18/22, 3:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Ko funny o 😂😂😂😂😂
5/18/22, 3:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah

They saw an opportunity to disrupt the space and they tap it straight
5/18/22, 3:30 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/18/22, 3:30 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. SQL talks too much. Python talks little and straight to the point.
5/18/22, 3:30 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😭😭😭
5/18/22, 3:30 PM - +234 816 484 7452: If they are building support for python already, then I expect that it will also speak to PySpark because the have decided to connect with Databricks on setting up lakehouse platform
5/18/22, 3:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: dbt is already a partner to Databricks
5/18/22, 3:31 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
5/18/22, 3:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And Databricks recently announced a launch of integrating with dbt Cloud
5/18/22, 3:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So I can tell you those guys get plan
5/18/22, 3:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Pele.... I think I will delay picking up dbt a little till the python API is ready.
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I meant that Databricks is probably part of the reason they needed to do python support
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Hmm. You are making sense
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Hmm

That maybe sha though there has been a huge demand from the upstream core Data Engineers using dbt
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Una DE too like stress
5/18/22, 3:32 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The coolest thing I found out this week is that, as a SOFT staff you have access to all the trainings and certifications on Databricks with your email
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😭😭
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It is not stress but flexibility na
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And besides Python will permit some extremely mad complexities
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: One guy wrote an article bashing dbt for not integrating with Python 😂
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Trueeeeee sha
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I believe this 💯
5/18/22, 3:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You should expect things like this
5/18/22, 3:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It will ease my headache small sha. So @2347085316273 you dey right that SQL talks too much sometimes.
5/18/22, 3:34 PM - +234 816 484 7452: As a sharp boy that I am

I don quickly Enroll for full DE track on Databricks
5/18/22, 3:34 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And imagine re-using stuffs like crazy
5/18/22, 3:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know some transformations I can easily do with a Python script but need to think through approaching it with SQL. 

Una DE don wan make AE entry point hard now
5/18/22, 3:34 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Even beginners will be able to copy some codes that works 😂🤣
5/18/22, 3:35 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Abeg we no send entry point oo

Na how to make life easy
5/18/22, 3:35 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Assiinnn 
That tool ehn... The thing is just that it is a must for every data person
5/18/22, 3:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
5/18/22, 3:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But from the money part of things

Imagine running some mad freelance with dbt because of the python support and integration
5/18/22, 3:36 PM - +234 708 531 6273: <Media omitted>
5/18/22, 3:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Person like you @2348108522573 go get archive of SQL and python models to deploy on the go
5/18/22, 3:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omoooooooooooo
5/18/22, 3:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Like it is sweet cash out if you ask me.
5/18/22, 3:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/18/22, 3:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 2 weekends is enough to get some companies up and running
5/18/22, 3:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly my point oo

Reusability would increase and python Armies too would provide mad support for it
5/18/22, 3:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Make una sha pay tithe oo

5/18/22, 3:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Their primary reason for building it is because their partners influenced it
5/18/22, 3:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/18/22, 3:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But it is more money and adoption for dbt actually
5/18/22, 3:40 PM - +234 708 531 6273: All in all, Dimensional Modelling is still the pillar of AE. If you don't know how to translate business problems into a functional DM, no tool will help you 😅

That is AEs like Ope will always be boss in that area. No be by Python 😅
5/18/22, 3:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Recruiters go start dey add Python  for AE jobs now 💀💀
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - +234 806 842 8052: Busy body. Who send them message? 🤦🏽‍♂️
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Is there a major difference between relational modeling and dimension modeling
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I am a bit confused, please help
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This thing no be lie. 

Tool will be useless 😂😂
5/18/22, 3:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Have all the tools you won’t be able to do anything
5/18/22, 3:42 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Major difference to me is that the former is for transactional databases while the later is for data warehouse
5/18/22, 3:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Make dbt open up for remote global na 😭😭😭
5/18/22, 3:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
5/18/22, 3:43 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯
5/18/22, 3:43 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Hmmnn..okayyy
5/18/22, 3:43 PM - +234 803 884 6009: But you make use of both at some point right?
5/18/22, 3:43 PM - +234 803 884 6009: The first at database level and the latter at data warehouse level like you said
5/18/22, 3:43 PM - +234 816 484 7452: This is coming because

you can now use dbt from databricks platform

And having access to all of Microsoft Enterprise customers means more money
5/18/22, 3:44 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The guys who use Azure databricks sha
5/18/22, 3:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s not what I meant sef

I meant Job 😂😂😂
5/18/22, 3:46 PM - +234 708 531 6273: So the thing is that  transactional databases are not optimised for analytics.. They are optimised for recording a transaction in a database and making sure they satisfy the ACID principle. If you want to use the database for purely analytics, DM is well optimized for that. So what is the purpose of your database? That will inform which one to use
5/18/22, 3:47 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Yes
5/18/22, 3:47 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This data field na life long learning if you wan survive 😂😂
5/18/22, 3:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Unless you no wan collect big bag
5/18/22, 3:48 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Understood
Thank you very much
5/18/22, 3:48 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Swears😭😭
5/18/22, 3:49 PM - +234 708 531 6273: It is o. My head sef is tired.

5/18/22, 7:16 PM - +234 708 531 6273: No. That is an entirely different type of database. This type of  database was built to make analytics faster. The earlier discussions are more of design patterns and not a type of database .
5/18/22, 7:23 PM - Condil: It's clearer now. Thanks

5/19/22, 9:51 AM - +234 818 047 2075: May be i should also the question here.

So we are trying to build a powerapps platform across our group and we need to share with another subsidiary within the group but under a different domain
5/19/22, 9:52 AM - +234 813 556 4853: 😂
5/19/22, 9:55 AM - +234 818 047 2075: As an alternative, we had built a Microsoft forms since there are no issues around sharing. But the only challenge we have now is with the location field. We need the location field in the form to be limited to the locations available per subsidiary. Currently it is giving all possible locations.
5/19/22, 9:55 AM - +234 818 047 2075: *drop the question
5/19/22, 9:57 AM - +234 706 057 7846: I am back online
5/19/22, 9:58 AM - +234 808 589 7009: 💪💪
5/19/22, 10:00 AM - +234 706 057 7846: You can address this by adding Branches to the form. Just that you will have  to add location questions for as many subsidiaries as you have.

Branches will help route each location based on the subsidiaries chosen.

Do let me know if you need further clarification
5/19/22, 10:00 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks 🙏🙏. We will try this out

5/19/22, 3:51 PM - +234 703 160 7868: The fintechs that'll remain standing after this MTN invasion are the ones that are able to innovate their products around the mobile money platform either through partnership or collaboration. The good thing is MTN already has the customer database and infrastructure, all they should is build their products around it.
5/19/22, 3:54 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Of all the problems in this country, our biggest companies are all thinking about Fintech.

Folks who should be leading in innovation are the ones leading in mob mentality.

Everyone and his cousin is now a Fintech CEO. 😒

5/19/22, 4:27 PM - Chinwe O: So smooth a transition for these service providers. Literally have the largest customers compared to all other fintechs that are emerging.

Plus, it will be easily adaptable to the regular people in rural communities. Your roadside “Iya Basirat” don’t need to be schooled on the many technologies on how to send and receive money.
5/19/22, 4:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I've set up personal and group financial coaching sessions.

If you'd like to get your money challenges sorted, here's the link to book a slot. 

It's ridiculously cheap considering the amount of effort I put into this. 
But it won't stay cheap for long.

Put you will still put your handle publicly 💀
5/19/22, 4:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: So, I am not the only one that thinks this.

I think Abeg helps focused and straightforward begging.
5/19/22, 4:56 PM - S+N Ayoade: And should have remained that to stand out uniquely.

But today, they’re doing all sorts..
5/19/22, 4:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Naso it dey be, increase your offerings.

So people won't have to use another app when you can do the same.
5/19/22, 4:57 PM - S+N Ayoade: It started with recharge card.

I mean why will I use the money I begged for to buy recharge card 😂
5/19/22, 4:58 PM - S+N Ayoade: Why is piggyvest not increasing their offer to buying recharge card ?

Cowrywise?

Chaka ?
5/19/22, 5:04 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Piggyvest connected with Abeg.

They can decide to it they deem it fit. Maybe I am not getting your point.

*This is coming from a kind soul who doesn’t want to burn out* 😞
5/19/22, 6:11 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Okay now
5/19/22, 6:17 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🌚
5/19/22, 6:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I would love to see the answer to this
5/19/22, 6:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Boss the question is for everyone who can contribute 

Please help us out 🤲🤲
5/19/22, 6:20 PM - +234 706 057 7846: Thank you bro for this question 😸.

My eyes have seen shege.
I don't have all the answers but below are what I often do

1. I have links to some content that can be helpful. I have them pinned already to my Google keyboard. So I just share the links.

2. I find rhythm in the issues people brought to me and I create videos on my YouTube channel for them.
I even created a free Mentorship course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/data-analyst-mentorship-for-absolute-beginner/?referralCode=F93BF843FC82750A8134
30minutes but full of answers to common questions that 1 out of 3 people ask me.

3. Some people have unique needs, so I try to schedule a 15 minute call with them. I always keep to 15mins. I also document the discussion and action points. If the people come back later and haven't gone past the stage, that's a No for me.

4. On weekends or any day less busy, I go through my LinkedIn and Twitter DMs and try to respond to as many as possible. 
This has been most efficient for me. I also don't want people to think that I look down on them because they haven't made it 😂. Even a response saying *"Hi, thank you for reaching out. I am very busy this period but I will try my best to provide answers to your questions. If you didn't get to hear from me after 2 weeks, please say hi again".*

I also have this pinned on my keyboard again.

These are what I do majorly to address this overwhelming audience.
5/19/22, 6:21 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Good evening Data Lord 🙇🏽‍♂️,

Does being an independent contractor for a remote company (when you're meant to be a FT staff) have any repercussions? financially or otherwise..

Thanks
5/19/22, 6:21 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Nymber 4 works 🤣
5/19/22, 6:22 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Thanks boss fkr sharing this
5/19/22, 6:22 PM - +234 812 091 9501: You will find out that most people a4e not even really interested.. They just want to hop on the data (tech) train
5/19/22, 6:23 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Independent contractor has to do with remote roles most times where the company is not available locally 

So you can’t get tax payments benefits , insurance etc

You handle those things yourself
5/19/22, 6:23 PM - +234 812 091 9501: What I do most times is refer you to some resources and see whether they would come back
5/19/22, 6:23 PM - +234 812 091 9501: If you come back, then I know you are serious if not, I won't stress myself
5/19/22, 6:24 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Number 4 is golden 💯💯

Many thanks for this
5/19/22, 6:24 PM - +234 817 965 1769: I do this too
5/19/22, 6:24 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Number 4 works most times
5/19/22, 6:24 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I guess I would have to analyze the patter of their questions too and use the clipboard thing
5/19/22, 6:24 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Very few people actually have the grit and commitment to learn
5/19/22, 6:24 PM - +234 816 484 7452: True
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🥲
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I think I would need calendly for that 15 mins thing too
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Thanks.
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Start with this question


Can you be specific on how you want me to help you?
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Most people won't come back
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
5/19/22, 6:25 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Or they would take some days or weeks to reply

Then, you have more time to relax
5/19/22, 6:26 PM - +234 706 057 7846: Yes. That is what I use. I have it synced with my Zoom too
5/19/22, 6:26 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂
5/19/22, 6:27 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I am telling you..
You will hear I want to learn data science

I usually ask..
What do you want to achieve with this?

How much time can you commit to this?

And many questions

By the time I ask you questions, you self will go and rethink
5/19/22, 6:28 PM - +234 812 091 9501: If the person doesn't even habe any idea, I will just recommend, go and start with Excel

If you can learn commit to learning Excel, then maybe you are ready
5/19/22, 6:29 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Step 1:Mute your WhatsApp and media notifications. 

Step 2: Only respond to what you can per time.

Step 3: You can acknowledge a message and ask the sender to send a reminder at a specified date/time. 

Step 4: When you have multiple people asking for the same thing, 
a. Create an answer template with FAQs and your response. 
b. Organise a virtual event and invite all of them so you deal with the issue once. 
Then save that video for future asks.
5/19/22, 6:29 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I am sure someone like Itunu and @2348160626971 that just got new roles will hsve their DMs full 🤣🤣
5/19/22, 6:30 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Too much wisdom mama
5/19/22, 6:31 PM - +234 703 806 5681: The way you people call me mama, an outsider will think I'm 40 with 10 children 😂
5/19/22, 6:32 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Which would you prefer tho?

Independent contractor or a Full time employee?
5/19/22, 6:35 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Nice
5/19/22, 6:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The Audit style

Solve everything at once
5/19/22, 6:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: As in, that's why I tagged her oo
5/19/22, 6:38 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Someone literally conducted full interview for me in the DM

Asking me why I think MS accepted me and even gave me options to pick from 😂🤣
5/19/22, 6:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Independent contractor is fine oo and best, I have served as that in a Free lance function 

I was able to bargain for alot of perks personally. The headache there is you doing your work and invoicing customer at the end of every month
5/19/22, 6:43 PM - +234 708 531 6273: If you are in Europe, the implication of IC is that you will have to register as a sole proprietor at the local tax office and won't have many employment benefits like Temi said.No insurance and other things that are made compulsory by the local labour law.  

You will be seen as an entrepreneur and the company contracting you will be seen as your customer. 

You will have to declare the taxes from your business(Your salary in this case) yourself and give the government their share. If you like, japa with it 😅

Also, because the company is not paying insurance and other stuff, your salary will be higher.

But in Nigeria, it is a no man's land. It doesn't matter like that which one you choose. In fact, just go the independent contractor thing if your are in Nigeria.
5/19/22, 6:44 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 👍
5/19/22, 6:45 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Thanks boss

5/19/22, 6:45 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Yeah. Also what has worked for me is to have dedicated days to respond. I only respond Tuesdays and Thursdays on Linkedin. I also have template answers ready because most requests are generic.
5/19/22, 6:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 😂😂true

Also I think the role is like this

Their current environment is heavily vested on SSIS and they won’t mind moving to MDS if that is what you are comfy with.

Also for the pay, discussion is currently ongoing on that

5/20/22, 11:03 AM - +234 703 845 5619: Good morning boss @Opeyemi Data Mentor , you once mentioned here that here that when implementing dimensional modelling in MDS there are some features of the Kimball dimensional model that may not be used in the MDS. 

If this claim is correct, 👀 please could you shed some more light or refer me to a reference material?

Thank you boss

5/20/22, 11:18 AM - +234 818 047 2075: I think ETL is one major concept in Kimball that no longer applies in MDS. ELT is the defacto but a number of other concepts still apply. I guess @2348108522573 will provide more info
5/20/22, 11:19 AM - +234 818 047 2075: I think this is hilarious

Thank you Kolapo
5/20/22, 11:26 AM - +234 703 845 5619: Basically, I want to confirm that the fundamentals of fact and dim tables and how it is modelled still applies. 

And If there are exceptions, I am happy to learn more.

Anyways, kindly check the data source. Probably, you changed data type or the DAX formula that was used in creating this visual as been deleted. But I suspect the error is coming from data source/type.

5/20/22, 12:59 PM - Anjola: No
This was the error I got after I checked how he was seeing the report from his end
5/20/22, 12:59 PM - Anjola: Yes
5/20/22, 1:00 PM - Anjola: It was published

Some can actually see the report
5/20/22, 1:01 PM - +234 818 047 2075: The problem is from the RLS. After sharing with the person, you need to also go to the RLS to add the person.
5/20/22, 1:01 PM - +234 818 047 2075: These people that can see have been configured under the RLS thats why. So add the person and 8t should work
5/20/22, 1:03 PM - Anjola: I did already but he is still not seeing it🥺

5/20/22, 1:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2347038455619 

Just as @2348180472075 mentioned Khimball approach majorly leveraged the ETL paradigm prior the Cloud DW where storage and computing resources was a limitation. 

Many approach proposed by Khimball still form the fundamental for any Dimensional Modeling, however there is more allowance for stuff as against the strict rules defined by Khimball. Interestingly many still hold on to Khimball, Data Vault and Immnon for that approach.  

So the fundamental of Khimball star schema, fact and dimensions still applies only that now we now have options of leveraging OBT (One big Table). The approach to Dimension modeling is now opinionated which is very challenging because you have to decide if you want to adopt Khimball or OBT or an Hybrid and also determine when using Khimball will be much better. 

Interestingly there folks that still adhere to Khimball 100%. I recently designed a model for a client discarding Khimball because I felt for that use case it won’t be optimal for downstream users. The client didn’t accept that they want to adhere strictly to Khimball. So lot of decision need to be made as it relate to approach and trade-off.
5/20/22, 1:11 PM - Anjola: If he is facing this issue 
Does that mean I’ll also face that same bug if I’m checking his report from my end(Test as role-RLS) ?
5/20/22, 1:13 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I may need to see this live to really understand what is going on. Hopefully this evening we can do a call. If it is urgent May be someone else in the group can help
5/20/22, 1:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Khimball want you to have degenerate and junk dimensions which aren’t really needed now because storage isn’t a big deal again.
5/20/22, 1:17 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Omo
5/20/22, 1:17 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Reverse ETL has now been renamed as Data Activation
5/20/22, 1:18 PM - Anjola: Quite urgent
5/20/22, 1:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes, it does.
5/20/22, 1:20 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Thank you boss
5/20/22, 1:22 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Does the user have access to the SO Real Time Dataset????

1. Go to Datasets + Dataflows

2. Select SO Real Time Dataset 

3. Select manage permission

4. Add User
5/20/22, 1:23 PM - +234 806 593 5396: If No, the do the highlighted steps above.
5/20/22, 1:24 PM - Anjola: Yes
He does

He is on the list
5/20/22, 1:24 PM - +234 703 845 5619: please what key factors do you consider when making a decision of whether to day with Kimball or OBT or hybrid?
5/20/22, 1:24 PM - Anjola: Maybe I should refresh the datasets again
5/20/22, 1:26 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Which did you grant the user access?
5/20/22, 1:26 PM - Anjola: SO Realtime
5/20/22, 1:30 PM - +234 806 593 5396: This usually takes 24hrs Sis.... advise the user to calm down... hopefully the report will work fine tomorrow

5/20/22, 1:31 PM - +234 703 845 5619: 😅😅, Okay I get now boss
5/20/22, 1:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 📌 Downstream user -  Are they tech savvy or non-tech? If non-tech I will most likely give them a OBT final model

📌 How long will it take to build the model? Will the build time be reduced if I use a star schema or OBT?

📌 Do I want to reduce duplicate or handle SCD?

Lot of decisions to be made really and they are opinionated
5/20/22, 1:34 PM - +234 703 845 5619: hmmm , thank you boss
5/20/22, 1:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Requires a lot of thinking and assumptions really.
5/20/22, 1:41 PM - Anjola: Oh
Okay
I’ll do this

Thank you so much @2348180472075 @2348065935396 🙏🏽
5/20/22, 1:42 PM - Anjola: And can this issue also arise from the server being down?
Data flows and data sets have been having refresh failures since yesterday
5/20/22, 1:42 PM - Anjola: The confusion was some could view the same report
5/20/22, 1:56 PM - +234 818 047 2075: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 1:58 PM - +234 806 593 5396: If I'm in your shoe, I will actually use this fact to buy more time....


But if you granted the access today, it usually takes 24hrs before the user can start viewing the report cos of dataset dependencies and the way your power bi infrastructure was setup.

No be beans to be a Power BI Developer Baba 😂
5/20/22, 2:06 PM - +234 813 687 5225: Oh!! I actually misinterpreted the error... You know you could encounter this on desktop, where you change the data type/source and it will start showing errors. 

Just noticed it's a Row Level Security issue.

Every problem is different. Building a model that works is hard.

Coming up with a template that works every time is probably naive, but there are building blocks that don't change.

I distilled my process into six steps.

5/20/22, 6:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Immediately he said tricky, I guessed that the SUM won't count the NULLs.
5/20/22, 6:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not the SUM
5/20/22, 6:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The filtering won’t capture NULL
5/20/22, 6:13 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yes, please... thank you for the correction.
5/20/22, 6:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But I can also argue that it will 😂

5/20/22, 6:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That the NULL is not null but NULL string
5/20/22, 6:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😅

Nice one...
5/20/22, 6:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Some dbt stores their null as string
5/20/22, 6:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *db.
5/20/22, 6:15 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Like?
5/20/22, 6:15 PM - +234 806 593 5396: that's the tricky aspect 😂 only people wey get inner eyes go see am
5/20/22, 6:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *db I meant.
5/20/22, 6:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: As an example any NULL in the db ingested by airbyte and I think Meltano will be loaded as Null string in the DW
5/20/22, 6:17 PM - +234 708 145 1890: This is what u was asking for.

Good to note, but sounds like a small sample size tho.
5/20/22, 6:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah yeah.
5/20/22, 6:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omoo that thing don frustrate me before na why I sabi 😂
5/20/22, 6:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omooo 

Some Null were null while some were NULL string  and some empty “”💀
5/20/22, 6:21 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Some? Haa....

I was thinking it would be all.

5/20/22, 7:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I remember when doing HTML templates for my lows, I had to go sit with a Front-end gym to explain somethings.

I was happy with myself at the end.
5/20/22, 7:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The truth actually is no matter how great low code or no code is there will always be that limitation where you will need to write some custom code to do some advanced stuff.
5/20/22, 7:15 PM - +234 816 296 3527: You go even need to build custom connectors sometimes sef
5/20/22, 7:17 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Broooo... Exchange On-prem suffered me this thing.

I find connector tire. Later resolved to using Teams Chatbot.

Now, I am back to the problem. 😂

I'm trying to build a pipeline in python that picks data from a BQ DB, does some analytics on the data and returns several aggregated/summary tables and plots as HTML outputs. Has anyone done something close to this please?
5/20/22, 8:37 PM - +234 814 833 4339: What's BQ db?
5/20/22, 8:37 PM - +234 708 145 1890: BigQuery I suppose
5/20/22, 8:38 PM - +234 814 833 4339: Okay

5/20/22, 8:43 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You mean the 1.5 GB for #500 wey boys like us dey always do? Like data to use the internet??
5/20/22, 8:43 PM - Abraham Musa: So, planning out how the reusable framework should be actually. I have the summary and plots in notebook environment but need to convert to python scripts so anyone can use the pipeline and generate the same output I've in notebook.
5/20/22, 8:44 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Wait! The notebook you are taking about, is it jupyter notebook??
5/20/22, 8:45 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Or it's normal notebook they use to write note in class?
5/20/22, 8:45 PM - Abraham Musa: So stuffs like using markdowns in python scripts, printing tables and graphs within same script but then finally exporting as HTML output.

5/20/22, 8:48 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. Exactly

5/20/22, 9:05 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The general idea about the role is to oversee turning data into something that can be utilised and understood not just by technical people
5/20/22, 9:05 PM - +234 708 145 1890: @2348108522573 @2349048946475 


I am not sure I can answer this question well. Please help 🙏🏾
5/20/22, 9:05 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Ahan boss!!!
Which one be DRE again bayi???

Na SRE we know ooo🌚💀🌚
5/20/22, 9:07 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Thank you boss.

As someone that as worked as an Systems Analyst and Product Owner.

I am quite familiar with Products and Data Teams and handling Stakeholder expectations.
5/20/22, 9:07 PM - +234 904 894 6475: For example, a data product can be a metric (or suite of metrics), a dashboard, a machine learning model, a ML platform, an experimentation platform, etc.

In many cases, these various products are technical products. The job of a data product manager is to strip of all the technical complexities so that a business or other type of non-technical user can use it efficiently.
5/20/22, 9:07 PM - +234 708 145 1890: @2348163982854 

We talked about it a bit here.
5/20/22, 9:08 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes, DRE is the data counterpart of SRE. It's a very prominent role
5/20/22, 9:09 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Wawu, that's deep!
5/20/22, 9:09 PM - +234 816 398 2854: Yeah I can see that now
5/20/22, 9:09 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 😂😂😂
It's a very prestigious role
5/20/22, 9:10 PM - +234 904 894 6475: DRE is an engineering role. Data product manager is a technical leadership role.
5/20/22, 9:10 PM - +234 708 145 1890: And I am really looking forward to it.
5/20/22, 9:11 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I was just about saying this.

Most times the role is asking for more years of experience.
5/20/22, 9:11 PM - +234 904 894 6475: It's interesting because most manager roles in the data space are more of management than technical leadership, but the data product manager role just hit different.
5/20/22, 9:19 PM - +234 904 894 6475: What makes the role really interesting is that it puts you at the interface of business strategy and technical leadership. Most data product managers I know are strongly business-oriented, yet technically excellent in data. I've been taking a lot of interest in this role lately.
5/20/22, 9:22 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly 😂
Na this kind role go make person pampers fall if you are not well versed both on the business and technical side of data
5/20/22, 9:23 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Contrary to the opinion that Product Management is a non-technical role.

I think for a Product Manager to be very effective, you need to understand (and if possible have experience) in the Technical aspects.

But can envisage the Business Value. They should be able to translate Business Value to Technical and vice versa.

Very strong directional role.

🙌🏾
5/20/22, 9:25 PM - Condil: This definition makes it sounds like a data scientist will be more fit for it than a data engineer.
5/20/22, 9:29 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Ajasa SUKANMI.vcf (file attached)
5/20/22, 9:29 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Boss please add
5/20/22, 9:29 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Emmanuella Olorunsagba.vcf (file attached)
5/20/22, 9:29 PM - +234 812 216 8133: And
5/20/22, 9:29 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks
5/20/22, 9:30 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly. Over the years, we've seen a lot of cases of non-technical product managers managing software or data teams, and sometimes it causes distasters because such product managers are often in parallel with the technical team. 

In fact, most times the success of technical projects cannot be attributed to the product manager because they mostly don't understand what the technical team is doing. Success mostly depends on how well the technical team lead understands the business and is able to communicate efficiently with the product manager. 

But at the end, na product manager dey collect glory 😂
5/20/22, 9:31 PM - +234 904 894 6475: So that's where data product managers make a difference. They are like technical product managers, but with prior experience in data
5/20/22, 9:31 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I can totally relate with this.
5/20/22, 9:33 PM - +234 708 145 1890: My issue now is distinguishing between a Data Team Lead and a Data Product Owner.

Will a Data Product Owner still report to a Data Team lead?

Or the structure is different with Data Products.
5/20/22, 9:33 PM - +234 904 894 6475: It really depends. In most cases I've seen, data product managers are those who were previously data scientists. But then, I know even DAs and DEs too can become data product managers. The idea is to be able to build, scale and democratise a data product. And data products can be either analytics, engineering or machine learning products.
5/20/22, 9:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I don miss ooo
5/20/22, 9:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Let me go and read the convo
5/20/22, 9:35 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Write your own Python Class
And you can publish it as a package 
Then Airflow it if you want

But having it in a class will solve the headache
5/20/22, 9:35 PM - Condil: I'll simply assume those DE have once been a data scientists.
5/20/22, 9:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Or use Pyscript
5/20/22, 9:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Wow I am late to this party 🤣😂
5/20/22, 9:37 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah
5/20/22, 9:38 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Na every software Engr term wan enter Data Space

Issokay
5/20/22, 9:39 PM - +234 816 484 7452: There are only three roles I know in Data

Data Analyst, Data Scientist(where AI or ML or anything engineer) and DE

*All other roles dey disguise one way or the other* 🤣😂
5/20/22, 9:44 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Honestly, the space is still new. So there's a lot of disparity in how organisations handle data products and the associated roles. But typically, a data product manager will be in charge of data team leads, especially if the role is generic. What I mean is that some data product managers are tasked with very generic responsibilities, like handling the entire suite of data products. So imagine if the person is to coordinate everything from metrics to dashboards to machine learning to experimentation. Then you can be sure he or she will be supervising several team leads.

However, some data product manager roles can be very specific. E.g., some just require you to focus on ML platform and strategy. In that case, such a person may be directly leading a team.

Finally, I think there's a difference between a data product owner and data product manager. A data product owner may just own or build out something very specific and be in charge of that. More like the "individual contributor" role that is more common with senior software engineer positions. On the other hand, the data product manager will seat at the intersection of business strategy and technical operations. He will also manage people a lot, not just the product.
5/20/22, 9:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This 3 roles can’t do everything in all honesty.
5/20/22, 9:46 PM - +234 810 878 6913: You studied physics?

5/20/22, 9:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s why as organizations scale there will be need for more defined roles within the Data ecosystem. 

It’s only a proof that the best time to enter Data is now.  Loads of opportunities abound if you know your onions well

5/20/22, 9:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data Governance nko?? Where do you want to put it??
5/20/22, 9:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Or not needed?
5/20/22, 9:49 PM - +234 816 484 7452: DE can handle it
5/20/22, 9:50 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Some data product manager roles specifically require you to manage data governance. If you notice, core data scientists don't talk a lot in this area. Someone with a DE background will definitely be most suited for such a role.
5/20/22, 9:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Sure. That’s why I said as organization scale there will be need for more specialization
5/20/22, 9:51 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Pls, what's MVP?
5/20/22, 9:51 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Please link.

5/20/22, 9:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I agree. At the scale at which data is growing, it's unrealistic to try to fit all the data work into just those 3 areas. That's why you see emerging paradigms like analytics engineering, data products, etc
5/20/22, 9:53 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Data Management as a whole is not a small thing.

Apparently, in some places there's a Dsta Governance Board


Not to talk of Data Owner, Data Stewards
5/20/22, 9:53 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Most valuable player -Job dating 😂👍

All Data Product Managers I have seen are all core technical folks
5/20/22, 9:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Exactly. 

It will be unrealistic really. 

So @2348164847452  I no dey disguise as AE 😭😭

Don’t use style to enter me 😂😂
5/20/22, 9:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/20/22, 10:01 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Honestly, imagine if there's only 3 paradigms, where do we now classify you based on your current work functions? Data Analyst? Data Engineer? I think it will be more of Data Engineer at this point 😂

Even then, it will be weird. A data engineer will definitely need additional specific training to handle those functions. This is why it's just realistic to allow new data paradigms emerge and fill those gaps that DA, DE and DS cannot fill.
5/20/22, 10:03 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Make I go connect with am. Trying to have more data product managers in my network 😂

5/20/22, 10:07 PM - +234 904 894 6475: @2349031381743 this here corroborates what I mentioned earlier, that a DPM can come from other data backgrounds other than core DS

5/21/22, 8:18 AM - +234 803 810 5953: I think you have to install windows on your mac
5/21/22, 8:19 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Omo. No other hack?
5/21/22, 8:19 AM - +234 812 216 8133: This Tableau no dey give me power bi vibe😭
5/21/22, 8:20 AM - +234 813 324 1349: You can’t use Power Bi on Mac.
However, you need to partition your Mac to use windows and it depends on Memory.
At least 1TB.
5/21/22, 8:22 AM - +234 905 555 4527: Go and buy a Windows, babe.
5/21/22, 8:23 AM - +234 814 113 9601: You could install a Virtual machine on your mac (e.g. parallel desktop) and run PowerBI in the virtual machine. 

Never done it myself though; but I've seen it done.
5/21/22, 8:23 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Is it advisable?
5/21/22, 8:24 AM - +234 813 324 1349: Yes.
5/21/22, 8:24 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Wahala 😂
5/21/22, 8:25 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Pay for a windows server on cloud and install PowerBI on the VM like I know of Amazon Workspaces

then rdp into it
5/21/22, 8:26 AM - +234 813 324 1349: Yes. This is valid, but Power bi is a big software and you might not enjoy it on the virtual machine.

The best solution is to partition your Mac.
5/21/22, 8:27 AM - +234 905 555 4527: You can also try out Tableau, it works fine on Mac. @2348122168133
5/21/22, 8:28 AM - +234 904 894 6475: I would rather suggest you install windows in a VM, e.g., Oracle Virtual Box, instead of partitioning your PC.

That way, you can easily turn on or turn off Windows in the VM environment without ever leaving your Mac OS
5/21/22, 8:29 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks guys. I really appreciate your help.
5/21/22, 8:30 AM - +234 812 216 8133: I will give it try. Thanks

5/21/22, 10:50 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Good morning everyone. Please I have issue with connecting to a postgres docker dB using sqlalchemy. It keeps returning "password authentication failed for user ..." . The password works fine when I use pgcli and bash to connect. 

How do I resolve this ?
5/21/22, 10:54 AM - Condil: I haven't reached here. But is the password in line with the one you set in your environment variables?
5/21/22, 10:55 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Yeah.
5/21/22, 10:56 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Can you try using normal Postgres python package to connect 

Pyscopg or so
5/21/22, 10:59 AM - +234 909 717 3678: So the package I'm using is dependent of psycopg2. 

I'm following this dphi dataengineering bootcamp. 

The command looks like 
From sqlalchemy import create_engine. 
engine = create_engine("this is were I pass in the connection string") 
to test connection, I run engine.connect() and I get that error.
5/21/22, 10:59 AM - +234 909 717 3678: *dependent on
5/21/22, 11:01 AM - +234 816 484 7452: So here is what you can use to test

With the same connection strings, can you setup pgadmin4 and try to connect through it
5/21/22, 11:04 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Ok. Let me try that. Thanks
5/21/22, 11:05 AM - +234 703 932 8188: Does your password have a @ symbol?
5/21/22, 11:05 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Nope. Plain text
5/21/22, 11:06 AM - +234 703 932 8188: What is your connection string. Can you drop  it?
5/21/22, 11:07 AM - +234 703 932 8188: Maybe it didn't follow the structure?
5/21/22, 11:08 AM - +234 909 717 3678: "postgresql://root:root@localhost/ny_taxi"
5/21/22, 11:08 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Tried it. Same error
5/21/22, 11:08 AM - +234 703 932 8188: Nope
5/21/22, 11:09 AM - +234 703 932 8188: Where is your port?
5/21/22, 11:11 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Sorry, skipped the text. I added it here. Same error. 
"postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi"
5/21/22, 11:14 AM - +234 703 932 8188: Then it means your docker image is not actual running as localhost.  You might want to verify that
5/21/22, 11:15 AM - +234 909 717 3678: How do I do that ?
5/21/22, 11:16 AM - Joe: Thinking out loud

The DB is in a container and you're assessing it from?

It might be the localhost
5/21/22, 11:17 AM - +234 703 932 8188: docker ps
5/21/22, 11:19 AM - +234 703 932 8188: It should actually be the container name.  I run Postgres directly on my system. Localhost or 127.0.0.1 works fine
5/21/22, 11:20 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Ran it. I'm seeing "0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp" under the ports column.
5/21/22, 11:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: stop the docker service
5/21/22, 11:24 AM - +234 703 932 8188: Your port mapping is fine
5/21/22, 11:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: And tunnel the port 5432
5/21/22, 11:25 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Restart it again
5/21/22, 11:26 AM - +234 816 484 7452: docker run -p 5432:5432
5/21/22, 11:27 AM - +234 703 932 8188: docker inspect replace_with_your_container_name
5/21/22, 11:28 AM - +234 909 717 3678: Ok. Let me try these.

5/21/22, 11:46 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Can you drop it
5/21/22, 11:47 AM - +234 703 932 8188: But if you run your container in this format. You  should be able to reach it with localhost

5/22/22, 10:10 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Curious to know how *DISTINCT ** calculates it's output, any explanation would be appreciated
5/22/22, 10:28 AM - +234 706 439 6712: It only picks unique values and drops all duplicate from all fields ( columns)
5/22/22, 10:29 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Considering all fields?
5/22/22, 10:29 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Yes
5/22/22, 10:32 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Meaning GROUP BY on all fields should give same result
5/22/22, 10:36 AM - +234 812 216 8133: It chooses only unique values. 

Say you have a column having 
1) a
2) b
3) a
4) a

With 4 rows, but when you use distinct, it returns just 2, a and b.
5/22/22, 10:40 AM - +234 813 324 1349: GROUP BY groups unique records and allows you to perform aggregate functions.
5/22/22, 10:40 AM - +234 708 145 1890: That's if you are grouping by all columns.
5/22/22, 10:40 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Thanks,

This is distinct. I was particular about *DISTINCT ** and I think @2347064396712's submission is aligns with my though but there are other opinions that it considers the primary 🔑 column only
5/22/22, 10:41 AM - +234 706 936 1298: *mine
5/22/22, 10:42 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Unique records only
5/22/22, 10:42 AM - +234 706 439 6712: In some cases, yes, in other cases, no.  Both have their use- cases


Group is mostly used when you wish to form some aggregates on the selected fields
5/22/22, 10:43 AM - +234 706 439 6712: *group by
5/22/22, 10:43 AM - +234 706 439 6712: E.g 

YDB   ( Table name ) 


Name.     Sex      age 

Benny     m.         16 

Ope.        m.         44

 Alex.       m.        32


Benny.     m.       20 


Victor.    F.         28
5/22/22, 10:44 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Let's use  this table as an hypothetical case
5/22/22, 10:47 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Let's wish to find 


a) All unique entries

b) The average age
5/22/22, 10:47 AM - +234 708 145 1890: It's impractical to do a Group By on all columns.

It's like wasting resources if you ask me.
5/22/22, 10:48 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah.. Just trying to explain their distinctions/ use- cases  n go with one that's more efficient
5/22/22, 10:49 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Please go ahead boss... 🙏🏾 
Thank you.
5/22/22, 10:49 AM - +234 813 324 1349: Yeah.

It's best to use GROUP BY when you have aggregation in your SELECT statement.
5/22/22, 11:01 AM - +234 706 936 1298: I see they both give the same result but both have their pros and cons and level of efficiency.

Decided to try out these below queries on a dataset and they gave same result

*QUERY 1*
 SELECT
    DISTINCT *
    FROM health.user_logs
    
*QUERY 2*
  SELECT
    *
    FROM health.user_logs
    GROUP BY ID, log_date, measure, measure_value, systolic, diastolic

Both queries gives same result but you cannot aggregate on QUERY 1 e.g COUNT(DISTINCT *) except you use a CTE, For QUERY 2, you can aggregate but like someone said here, its inefficient or waste of resources to GROUP BY on all columns
5/22/22, 11:02 AM - +234 706 439 6712: a) 

SELECT DISTINCT* 

FROM YDP

ORDER BY Name;

*Output:* 

Name.     Sex.     age 

Alex          m.        32
Benny.      m.        16
Benny       m.        20
Ope.          m.        44
Victor.       f.          28


We still have Benny appearing twice because the ages are different
5/22/22, 11:02 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly...now u get the gist .
5/22/22, 11:07 AM - +234 706 936 1298: Much more clarity.

Especially that *DISTINCT ** considers all fields (columns) unlike other opinions that says it uses only the primary key column
5/22/22, 11:07 AM - +234 706 439 6712: If u just want to a quick view of ur records returning all unique entries, use Distinct * ( capturing the entire table ).  But use Distinct ( give it a direction here by inputting the field (s) of interest )


But when performing some aggregates on the detasets, better use *Group by*  saves time and energy....
5/22/22, 11:12 AM - +234 706 439 6712: That's for single table though.  .

But 
When it comes to multiple tables, u would need do some joining  or type out sub queries..  Queries inside queries..


Tinz get a bit complex here , one needs to be very  careful when handling multiple tables

5/22/22, 12:58 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Select distinct is a more expensive function in SQL from a performance perspective. It becomes noticeable when you are working with many records. A group by can typically achieve something similar faster and is a better alternative. I guess the data engineers here can tell us more about this.
5/22/22, 12:59 PM - +234 806 593 5396: @2348164847452 @2348027557589 @2347033167142
5/22/22, 1:02 PM - +234 802 755 7589: I’m not a data engineer but I can confirm that using distinct is a crime in my team. 

When I initially joined my coy, I would usually use it but my manager frown at it badly. 

Using distinct is a lazy way of hiding unnecessary spillover in data.
5/22/22, 1:23 PM - +234 810 878 6913: How can I become a data engineer?
5/22/22, 1:39 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think you should still use a group by here. It is probably more efficient. You can specify the columns. I doubt  there are use cases for finding distinct on say 10 columns. So groupby is still the go to.
5/22/22, 2:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s not totally true. 

There are instances you may need to deduplicate your data when you know duplication exist, and GROUP BY on the required fields is what you often will do to deduplicate
5/22/22, 2:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not always true sha. 

You can GROUPBY without aggregating as stated above.
5/22/22, 2:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This is inefficient when you have a huge data.
5/22/22, 2:22 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Exactly. 👍. Groupby is typically more efficient.

5/22/22, 2:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nice
5/22/22, 2:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah

Not like distinct is not something you can’t use but people have used in bad ways in the past there by abusing its use. 

In most cases people use it to hide badly written queries or codes in order to achieve their result and this can be consuming in some data env.

So there’s this tradition out there that if the data model is good and all , you can use other better options to get distinct data by using other alternatives.

Also to note that, distinct is inefficient in some data environments as it causes extra sorting of entire data and imagine if you now have so many records .
5/22/22, 2:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can’t use COUNT DISTINCT with a windows function in Redshift
5/22/22, 2:43 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I worked with a DE that don’t like seeing anything DISTINCT.  He will instead ask you to use a constant 1 to find what you are looking for alternatively
5/22/22, 2:44 PM - +234 816 484 7452: We have dropped a couple of post here already in that. But would check again and reshare.

This was years ago sha
5/22/22, 2:47 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Of course ooo

One of the reasons organization will always need CDOs and Head of Data roles. The demand from Non-Data literate stakeholders to see Data team as magicians to turn-in value in no time is funny 😂😂😂

Someone need to let them know the better the infrastructure, the more efficient the analysis activities with be.

What’s the best trade-off to have between technical data debt accumulation and Direct value stakeholders want to see as it relate to Data team structuring?

Would you want your team to be more BI focused (so more DA/DS ) or more backend intensive  and at what point do you switch?

5/22/22, 6:50 PM - Condil: Please I'm not really getting this aspect of contributing to open source as a data engineer, and it seems like there are some core fundamentals one need to focus on to get there, most especially cores of software engineering. I said this since ETL is mostly about tools, and open source tool are mostly tending towards an aspect of ETL.
5/22/22, 6:55 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think one very important thing for the data lead or head of data or CDO is to gain credibility and trust really fast. The how will vary from organisation to organisation based on maturity. For me, it was starting with BI because BI wasn't yet at a mature stage and I chose a use case that was visible to execs but also not to complex to execute. However, if I was leading the data team in a bank or telco, that probably won't fly, a DS use case would have been more ideal or even a DE use case where we simplify infrastructure and speed up time to insights. 

I think it is important to scan the landscape before setting up the team and determining the high value low hanging fruits.
5/22/22, 6:59 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think one also needs to move as fast as possible with a lean team. You can run BI and DS projects in parallel. If there a data issues, you can even add a data management project too. Getting visibility and credibility early is super important.
5/22/22, 6:59 PM - +234 818 047 2075: @2348108522573 does the above address your question?

5/22/22, 7:16 PM - +234 818 047 2075: One other thing that is critical is having a data strategy. The reason it is super important is that data teams can easily become more reactive than proactive. By reactive, I mean working on ad-hoc requests that have minimal impact. The strategy helps you ensure you are focused on the strategic use cases and not ad-hoc requests. Typically ad-hoc requests shouldn't take more than 30% of your teams time. Without a strategy, it will most likely take 90% especially because they will sound legitimate, important and urgent even though they add little value
5/22/22, 7:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Ad-hoc request can be killing truly and time taking. 

I had to tell all stakeholders to send in any ad-hoc request before 12noon 😂😂. 

You are 💯 spot about having a strategy in place to create room for proactive approach

5/22/22, 10:18 PM - +234 706 936 1298: I read Kolapo’s submission, 💯 spot on, my take and approach is quite similar.

There is usually a business strategy that spells out the must win battles for most/all businesses usually done with an OKR or Strategy Map/Scorecard, as a CDO, it’s best to obtain the business strategy in conjunction with some environment scanning and prepare a data/analytics strategic response to the business strategy. This response is in form of objectives or short-medium-long term plans of the data team that aligns with the business strategy, this may come with a couple of adjustment from the stakeholder. 

This gives a CDO an idea of what his/her team should look like in the next 12 months. 

From my experience, starting out a new team is usually BI focused especially in corporate/enterprise, might not be same for Startups, this is because there’s an urgent need to deliver tangible/impactful elementary results which a BI team can handle end-to-end. You begin to pitch the need to scale out the team and infrastructure after delivering some tangible results (which I think is similar to Kolapo’s stand on building credibility), this is where you bring in a DE/DS because there’s a need for speed and reduce time to insight. 

Prioritisation is the answer to ad-hoc requests, if not well managed, it can become a monster that keeps comings, you study the volume and frequency in a short period, the result will tell if you actually need to also scale up the BI resource in addition to scaling out to DE/DS even though you create time allowance in your initial strategy to give room for handling ad-hoc requests (you have to help save cost)

5/22/22, 10:44 PM - +234 703 845 5619: A strategy helps you to clearly define quick wins (low hanging fruits) usually BI that helps you provide immediate value for the business and increase your credibility, and then begin to work backwards for building DE infrastructure for long term and business scale. 

The strategy could even include data products for the long term. 

But the trade off depends largely on the data maturity level of the organisation and the immediate - long term business needs.

Earlier this year, I found one that has a reasonable price ~16k for a start, name is Ovaledge. I have been discussing with the vendor for a bit and I have seen that it has many features which means it is a one stop shop for cataloguing, lineage, Data Quality monitoring, Business glossary etc. The only part I am not sure it has is observability and I think that that is super important.

5/23/22, 12:45 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah, So for *Data Observability* . I asked myself if it checks these 3 boxes

1. Metrics (Data Quality) ✅
2. Metadata (data about data, like schema changes, logs etc) ✅
3. Lineage (dependencies between data assets)✅

And yes it does checks those boxes but getting the best out of it would depends on the kind of subscription you go for.
So it can pass for observability

*Reddit*

So far, no discussion has ever been made on it yet on reddit for both the Data Engr Space on reddit and the whole of reddit but I have posted it as a discussion for reviews from any DE or data person that has used it. You can follow the discussion here (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/uvxxnr/we_are_thinking_of_making_use_of_ovaledge_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

5/23/22, 2:19 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Very solid thoughts from @2348180472075, @2347069361298, @2347038455619 

To add to the interesting discussion, I like to look at the data value stream as a coin with three sides — Infrastructure/DE as one face, BI/DA as the other face, while Data Science (ML, research, experimentation, etc) as the edge. 

The infrastructure side is usually more of a long-term, indirect, value-generator for the business. BI/DA is typically the shortest-term value-generator. DS, being the edge, is the highest value-generating side and has the greatest potential for keeping a business ahead in light of competition and market share. We all know not every org needs to have (or can even have) all 3 in place immediately. Some start with BI, others with DE. DS typically comes in at varying levels of data maturity depending on the industry. For example, most large orgs typically focus first on BI just as @2347069361298 pointed out. Non-tech startups also focus primarily on BI, while for tech-heavy startups, the focus is mostly on data infrastructure and then DA/DS. 

When setting up a data team, knowing exactly which side(s) to focus on will depend on the org's maturity level and its short-medium-long term goals. This is where a data strategy comes in, to address the org's needs from where it currently is, and also give direction to it's growth trajectory in light of data value generation. For me, a data strategy should be a precursor to setting up a data team. Without data strategy, a data team could be headed for trajedy. 

Preparing a data strategy that translates business strategy into tactical technology execution and resultant business outcomes is one of the first things a CDO or Head of Data needs to do, except there's already a data strategy in place. In fact, sometimes, a data strategy changes business strategy and forces the business to adopt new initiatives that can give it the advantage in the market (e.g., what Netflix did by blending a defensive and offensive data strategy). This kind of data strategy optimises the business strategy until it reaches doninance.

For a Head of Data, I think the biggest challenge is in getting buy-in from senior leadership, especially in large orgs. As @2348180472075 pointed out, getting visibility and credibility early is very important. Senior leadership don't care about technology until it communicates value. The challenge is in making data strategy expressive enough that it transcends beyond the technology and workflows to growth opportunities that can meet or exceed business expectations. Technology is tactical, execs will only see strategy when the tech is connected to business outcomes. This is the only way to create trust, and without trust it's hard to get buy-in from senior leadership to support potentially valuable data initiatives.

This leads me back to the data value stream as a coin with 3 sides. As a way to build trust with execs, one key thing a data strategy must be able to communicate is near-term value generation. This is where BI comes in most times. Execs are able to quickly see and quantify business impact. Once trust can quickly be established, the data strategy can then go on to present the value proposition in the other 2 sides. Based on such a strategy, if I'm to build out a data team for a large org at a low data maturity level, the first 6 to 12 months would look something like 60-70% BI/DA, 20% AE/DE and 10-20% DS. Ad-hoc requests can be prioritised under the BI slot.

Once there's a track record of success, and credibility is established, senior leadership then knows they can trust you with value generation with DS and DE that can be more long-term. At this point, the focus can then shift significantly from BI. For tech-focused startups my approach will be different, my prioritisation will be heavier on DS and DE. This is because tech startups are generally already sold in on the huge potential of these 2 sides, not to mention those that focus heavily on data products.

5/23/22, 4:36 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Any of the engineers should be able to help. I think you need an ETL tool such as SSIS, Azure adf or other ETL tools
5/23/22, 4:38 PM - Joe: SQL has this event thing that can help with this
5/23/22, 4:38 PM - Joe: By SQL, I am referring to MySQL etc
5/23/22, 4:41 PM - +234 814 039 8140: A dblink can work also
5/23/22, 4:42 PM - +234 816 484 7452: What's the SQL environment for the two databases.

That would determine the method or way I would recommend
5/23/22, 4:45 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Microsoft Server. The change is to occur within this DBMS
5/23/22, 4:46 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Microsoft server
5/23/22, 4:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: You guys work together?
@2348175115556 & @2348179251327
5/23/22, 4:47 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Yes sir🌝
5/23/22, 4:47 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Yeah
5/23/22, 4:47 PM - +234 803 884 6009: How many records do you have in the table to be copied?
5/23/22, 4:48 PM - +234 817 925 1327: There are thousands of rows there. Does this need to be factored in?
5/23/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I was going to say you could generate the script to include the schema and the data and just run it against the other db
5/23/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 884 6009: But thousands of records is a lot
5/23/22, 4:49 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I am not sure that is the best approach to take
5/23/22, 4:49 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Ohh Ohh
5/23/22, 4:50 PM - +234 817 925 1327: It's quite much
5/23/22, 4:51 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The two databases are inside a MS Server?
5/23/22, 4:52 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I think so, yes
5/23/22, 4:53 PM - +234 803 884 6009: How about you use the sql server import and export wizard?
5/23/22, 4:53 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Have you tried that?
5/23/22, 4:53 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Yes sir
5/23/22, 4:53 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You can query directly now
5/23/22, 4:53 PM - +234 814 039 8140: Yes
5/23/22, 4:54 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Like just write a query to select from that DB table and save it directly as a table on the other db
5/23/22, 4:55 PM - +234 803 884 6009: This is another option. A select…. Into query
5/23/22, 4:58 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 4 ways to do it

1. Use the SELECT INTO QUERY
2. EXPORT/IMPORT WIZARD
3. Using Generate script if the table is not so large
4. If it is a different server, you can use a linked server option
5/23/22, 4:59 PM - +234 803 884 6009: No 1.
Select * into destinationdb.tablename
From  source db.tablename
5/23/22, 4:59 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Just google search the above things and you will be fine
5/23/22, 4:59 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Omo... Linked Server is med 😃
5/23/22, 4:59 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I have not used the last option before
5/23/22, 5:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And if the above seems stressful

Use
1. Airbyte
2. SSIS
3. ADF
5/23/22, 5:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: These ones would be more stressful sha 😂😂
5/23/22, 5:01 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Baba o🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
5/23/22, 5:01 PM - +234 814 039 8140: Might be needing drivers
5/23/22, 5:02 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I have sha learnt something today
Thank you
5/23/22, 5:03 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Thanks Boss. I'll do that and get back
5/23/22, 5:04 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea... but SSIS since it's SQL server should be much stress.
5/23/22, 5:04 PM - +234 817 925 1327: <Media omitted>
5/23/22, 5:05 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Linked Server is like mirroring db .... I configured it some years for a client 😀 hopefully @2348164847452 will give us the tutorial on how to configure it
5/23/22, 5:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You can spin up docker for Airbyte locally and run it
5/23/22, 5:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂🤣
5/23/22, 5:06 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I am try to look it up here
Interesting
5/23/22, 5:06 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Or if you have good python skills.

You can write python script to archive your result also 🤣😂
5/23/22, 5:07 PM - +234 817 925 1327: افسح الطريق 🥲
5/23/22, 5:09 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You would need PYODBC python package for this
5/23/22, 5:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I doubt 

Airbyte is pretty easy to setup. 

They’ve improved better unlike when they started 

Myself & @2348106129023 suffered sha 😂😂😂
5/23/22, 5:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They were still at Beta stage when we used them so they had a couple of unresolved issues.
5/23/22, 5:21 PM - +234 703 845 5619: nah... Airbyte is easy cheesy even for a non data engineer... really really easy to setup and maintain.
5/23/22, 5:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nice 👍 

Well done @2348179251327 

You have all the support you need, just throw the question here
5/23/22, 5:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah 

I disturb them tire then 😂😂
5/23/22, 5:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I was even named Airbyte trailblazer for a week 😂
5/23/22, 5:22 PM - +234 703 845 5619: 😅😅
5/23/22, 5:25 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Thanks so much sir
5/23/22, 5:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This is solid 🔥 

Thanks @2349048946475 

Spot on. 

The best of Data initiatives can be pinned on the right Data strategy truly. The right strategy will influence the kind of data to be collected as well as the required infrastructure that will power the projected use case. 

No doubt the skill sets required as a core technical person is somewhat different from Leading Data team.
5/23/22, 5:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Thanks for sharing @2347069361298 @2348180472075 @2349048946475
5/23/22, 5:28 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Cool
That’s nice

I was looking at the last time I set it up actually 

But I know it’s pretty easy with docker now sha
5/23/22, 5:29 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I never Dey lead any team

Na why I kuku no look the question 
Who am I 🤣😂
5/23/22, 5:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They’ve improved on it 🫡. The way those guy grew shock me 😂😂. They were less than 8 when I used it then, so it was easy for me to slide into any one’s DM 😂. 

Now they are almost 100 in the space of a year with massive funding

5/24/22, 11:11 AM - +234 806 347 2085: Good morning all. Please I am filling my details on hired.com. I chose some locations that I would love to work in and the US is among. They asked if I am authorized to work on the United States. Do I choose no? Bearing in mind that it might affect my being recommended to companies in the US looking for remote workers
5/24/22, 11:22 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Good morning. 
I think you should choose no unless you have permission to work in the state already. It is not likely to affect your remote work, but employers who need onsite workers and can't afford visa sponsorship will not be able to hire you. Some of them will ask if you will require visa sponsorship as well. 

If you say you have the authorisation to work, you will be asked to present evidence to prove it.
5/24/22, 11:22 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Are you in the US?

If you have the predictive metrics built out in your model files then why not. But it doesn’t provide the feature. At least I’m not aware of such feature.

5/24/22, 7:16 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Sometimes, charts (and maps) are give the best description of data.
Other times numbers the crispiest option available. Therefore, a good data professional should be able to switch modes when necessary

One tool that helps geographers switch between space and numbers is spatial weights and spatial autocorrelation.

Spatial weights help you describe geographical relationships with numbers. 

In this notebook, I explored various spatial weighing techniques using the PySal library.

5/24/22, 8:31 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Two things I believe will keep Microsoft as a major vendor now and in coming years are the Enterprise penetration advantage and the ecosystem it has built around products.
5/24/22, 8:32 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I like the fact that they are integrating everything. 

See how PowerBI integrates with other Power platform tools. Now they have aldo announced an Intelligent data platform that will integrate analytics, governance and databases 🔥.

5/24/22, 9:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Most likely Enterprise and not Big tech or startup. Which means the report is subjective too.
5/24/22, 9:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Let me keep quiet before Microsoft people come for my neck 😂😂😂
5/24/22, 9:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m not kuku loyal to any tool.

5/24/22, 9:32 PM - +234 706 057 7846: Indeed, it is. The need to put power to build and create in the hands of Citizen Developers will continue to exist and Microsoft is creating a timely solution.

Personally, coming from a WordPress background, I know this new service will sell and I love it
5/24/22, 9:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m honestly curious on the companies Gartner carry research on 

During one of my research I discovered Forrester, another Data research company interviewed thought leaders of enterprise companies which form the basis of a report they released. 

If we leverage of that understanding for Gartner too that means that report is subjective and the premise should be defined really 😂😂
5/24/22, 9:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m sure if it was conducted for Big Tech, Start up and scale up companies it will most likely be a different result.
5/24/22, 9:34 PM - +234 816 484 7452: <Media omitted>
5/24/22, 9:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I believe it’s enterprise too.

5/24/22, 9:38 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Medium to large organisations. Thats why the likes of Metabase, Superset are not there
5/24/22, 9:38 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Same with Forrester
5/24/22, 9:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Exactly.  

Which means when quoting that report it should be defined well.
5/24/22, 9:42 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Between 100 - 150

It depends though
5/24/22, 9:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Microsoft own the enterprise BI space and I don’t see any product that will beat that.
5/24/22, 9:43 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And that is where the money is

5/24/22, 9:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: True and like @2348164847452 said that is where the money is.
5/24/22, 9:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: If the report had to cover startups too, they will probably have to review several known and unknown vendors.
5/24/22, 9:47 PM - +234 816 484 7452: *Please why are so many companies hiring Data Engrs at this time*

5/24/22, 10:03 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Good evening all. I was given a take-home test to do for the role of data analyst/powerBI developer that I applied for in a company. The test is to analyse ttthe given datasets and make a powerBI report. Is there anything that I would need to pay specific attention to while doing my Viz? Or I should just watch out for trends in the data and visualize?
5/24/22, 10:03 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Thanks bro

5/24/22, 10:04 PM - +234 706 057 7846: MY THOUGHT
If you are in an enterprise business, you will understand that the value that Microsoft Suite offers is difficult to be outcompeted by any other BI tools in the industry for some years. 

For example, subscription for Zoom per user per month will get you the minimum Microsoft 365 Packages for a year which comes with over 15 Apps and Services. The same thing goes for ClickUp and many other Apps and services out there.

These Apps and Services (Microsoft's) when combined together can solve $100k+ business problem in many scenarios. This is why the enterprise value will continue to be a great advantage.

Coming down to BI Tools, the ability to use Power BI for Free within SharePoint List, within MS Teams for Teams Activity Analytics, and several other embedding capabilities within the ecosystem will earn then the top tier always.
When a growing Startups get to a point where they started getting matured in Processes around Risk, Compliance, and Audit (on Data, Processes, and Regulatory domains), they will most likely adopt Microsoft Services to easily navigate that scenario but I stand to be corrected.

Microsoft One Oasis playbook is the Ecosystem. They will continue to leverage on this to become leader in many technology areas in the coming years.

5/25/22, 5:59 AM - +234 806 593 5396: In @2348108522573 voice, 

1. Torture the dataset until it obey to you.

2. Add a date table for time intelligence analysis...and remember to mark the date column of your date table as date.

3. You can also extract the dimension table and fact table from the dataset, this will help your data modelling. 

4. If it's a Senior role and you need the job badly, then feel free to impress them with unlimited DAX measures.

5. Don't do one page Visualisation. Atleast 3 pages with different stories. 

6. You can show up by adding the page navigation experience to your submission but don't overdo it.

All the best....

5/26/22, 12:15 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Hi friends,
Please I need some assistance installing my tensorflow on anaconda
I've use 
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
but failing at many points of the installation process.
Any better way to get it done is welcomed, thanks.
5/26/22, 12:16 PM - +234 803 836 4706: sorry what operating system are you using
5/26/22, 12:17 PM - +234 803 836 4706: it's always easier on linux and mac than window system
5/26/22, 12:19 PM - +234 814 669 0593: pip install tensorflow 

It will install the latest variant and you don't need to worry about CPU or GPU 

If you encounter any issue, 
Post the error
5/26/22, 12:19 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Windows
5/26/22, 12:19 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Ok
5/26/22, 12:19 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Though I've tried similar ways but didn't work. Nonetheless I'll try this
5/26/22, 12:20 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Using pip in conda is highly frowned at.

Just a general advice
5/26/22, 12:20 PM - +234 814 669 0593: For TF, just use pip
5/26/22, 12:20 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Okay
5/26/22, 12:20 PM - +234 903 783 8682: But if you must use pip then I suggest you create a new environment for tensorflow.
5/26/22, 12:23 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Well, I haven't installed tensorflow on my machine before.

What I said is just a general advice.

But since you sound so convinced, how sure are you that it won't cause dependency issues?
5/26/22, 12:24 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Moreover, why don't you just use Google Collab?
5/26/22, 12:24 PM - +234 806 450 4878: This was how I got it installed initially, before the anaconda crashed
5/26/22, 12:24 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Like you said, create an environment for it.

I just find it easier to install Tf with pip in any environment. 

I have been using I like that since tf 1.x
5/26/22, 12:25 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Yh, I use colab but not as convenient as anaconda. Besides I need to trigger my webcam but colab can't handle that(atleast not easily)
5/26/22, 12:28 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Create an environment for it and try using pip and see if it works. 

If you have GPU and you want to install TF alongside cudnn and cuda toolkit,  you can try conda
5/26/22, 12:29 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Yh, I'll just install on a different environment
5/26/22, 12:29 PM - +234 903 783 8682: 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾

Different strokes for different folks.

On the other hand, geopandas will never install with pip. It's either conda or nothing. Lol
5/26/22, 12:29 PM - +234 806 450 4878: Thanks
5/26/22, 12:31 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Yeah. 

Some dependencies issues. 

Shapely,  folium and some others will act up. 

I install them manually sometimes
5/26/22, 12:33 PM - +234 903 783 8682: You do geo?
5/26/22, 12:33 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Sometimes
5/26/22, 12:34 PM - +234 903 783 8682: So your background isn't GIS. But you're familiar with geospatial libraries?
5/26/22, 12:35 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hello everyone, please who is familiar (or has experience) with open banking and how financial service institutions can monetise data through it.
5/26/22, 12:36 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Yes.

I am familiar with some geospatial libraries and tools
5/26/22, 12:37 PM - +234 810 831 6393: On which OS sure?
5/26/22, 12:38 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Sire*
5/26/22, 12:41 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Pip works seamlessly on Linux, but on windows, you’ll need to create a new environment, and do your installation thereafter
5/26/22, 12:41 PM - +234 810 831 6393: For GeoPandas
5/26/22, 12:42 PM - +234 905 555 4527: 🥳🥳🥳.

5/26/22, 1:40 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Hmmmm

Did something on this at some point but the project didn’t fully start.

I left before inception. I kinda have some materials but I would check sha.

The project was focused on Creating a Loan Platform with credit scoring enability. 

I doubt Open Banking in itself is a possible no brainer here in Nigeria

5/26/22, 5:42 PM - +234 816 398 2854: What do you mean by "flag"?
5/26/22, 5:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Sincerely

5/26/22, 5:42 PM - +234 806 347 2085: But what did you now tell them after they reached out? Is it possible to convert some to something tangible?
5/26/22, 5:43 PM - +234 802 755 7589: Actually @2347068709716 confirmed the location thing when he first arrived in the UK
5/26/22, 5:43 PM - +234 816 484 7452: So if you change your location to US and San Francisco.

You would see what I am talking of
5/26/22, 5:43 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah he did
5/26/22, 5:43 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I wasn’t looking for job na.
5/26/22, 5:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I just wanted to test my curiosity that I’m not cursed na Nigeria cause am. 

I respond to the ones that have big names and the ones that don’t I ignored. 

I did interview for 2. The moment I told them I was in Nigeria them ghost me
5/26/22, 5:44 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Wàhálà...🥲

5/26/22, 5:51 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Straight up
5/26/22, 5:52 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Exactly. At a point I was wondering if something was wrong. The rejection and the ghosting was too much
5/26/22, 5:52 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You didn’t see how I was ghosted when I said I am available to be sponsored to japa 😂😂😂
5/26/22, 5:54 PM - +234 806 347 2085: 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Na better ghosting oo
5/26/22, 5:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2348163815935 

Remember the UK one? 😂
5/26/22, 5:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Baba has praised my profile well until I told him I’m in Nigeria 🇳🇬 😂
5/26/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 398 2854: It's annoying tbvh
5/26/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Upon changing your location 

Make sure you settle things in the DM oo. Let them know that you are in Nigeria.

Don’t go and register on their HR system and they now end up flagging you so you won’t be able to apply to them again
5/26/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 398 2854: No be say you no dey skills
5/26/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 398 2854: 💀💀💀
5/26/22, 5:58 PM - +234 903 783 8682: An interesting line in many job descriptions and is "remote (UK)".

Who has seen that line before?
5/26/22, 5:58 PM - +234 903 783 8682: <Media omitted>
5/26/22, 5:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It is actually 😂
Now I don’t have energy 

Now I ask them straight up for the ones that look like I like “How much is pay, I’m in Nigeria and is it open to relocation” before you stress my life. 

That’s my template now for any recruiter that reach out.
5/26/22, 6:07 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Why include remote there? I mean just put UK based let the rest of us go and sleep
5/26/22, 6:09 PM - +234 806 347 2085: I don see 'remote (US)' tire
5/26/22, 6:10 PM - +234 810 686 4060: God epp us😢
5/26/22, 6:11 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 😂😂 some UK companies sponsor also. It is very common from big 4 here to big 4 there. But other organisations there do it too
5/26/22, 6:11 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Amen sister
5/26/22, 6:11 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think the world is opening up fast and in 1 to 2 years remote jobs in tech will increase significantly.
5/26/22, 6:12 PM - +234 806 347 2085: I really hope so
5/26/22, 6:14 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think it will. Once competency is established, these places will realise it is cheaper to hire Africans. Challenge is there are still questions around competency. But that is probably slowly fading now.
5/26/22, 6:15 PM - +234 806 347 2085: You have a point
5/26/22, 6:15 PM - +234 818 047 2075: And by the way it is not just tech. I know 2 people, one in strategy consulting and the other in finance/accounting who got Canada and US remote jobs respectively  2 months ago.
5/26/22, 6:16 PM - +234 818 047 2075: That's why they go to places like India.
5/26/22, 6:17 PM - Abraham Musa: I think of two factors when evaluating the reasons some global organizations don't really like to employ and relocate foreign talents:
1. Not all organizations can issue COS - Certificate of sponsorship.  I think UK government even has list of eligible companies self
2. Most companies don't want go bear that responsibility cos first, they always think they can hire from within the country or probably there's a high chance if you're relocated, you might leave them for another employer. From the company side, it's pretty expensive actually to relocate a single professional. 

Regardless sha, I still think consistency is a very important metric in getting a global role that comes with relocation. It's a mixture of strategy plus consistency.
5/26/22, 6:20 PM - Abraham Musa: In UK for instance, I think organizations need to prove in a way that they couldn't hire anybody locally before proceeding to bring someone from the abroad.
5/26/22, 6:22 PM - +234 806 347 2085: But what about the remote jobs that you can do in your current location. They also reject for such roles
5/26/22, 6:23 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. And that's why @2348180472075 talked about competence. Sometimes I like to think that for every global role put on social media, there's about 50+ persons applying to same role.  Depends though
5/26/22, 6:24 PM - Abraham Musa: So, whether the role requires relocation or not, competence is another interesting topic entirely. The ability to package and sell your self very well is another.
5/26/22, 6:24 PM - +234 806 347 2085: True
5/26/22, 6:31 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Let's stay consistent and keep doing the hard work. International roles will definitely come. I believe it is  a matter of time. Things are really moving fast and it is probably closer than we think.
5/26/22, 7:34 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Boss, good evening.
Are you available for a talk, please 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
5/26/22, 7:35 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay

5/26/22, 8:10 PM - +234 813 882 2739: Many organizations aren’t just interested in the stress, especially if the level isn’t high… I know organizations who would only sponsor a certain level of experience meanwhile even their graduate programs qualify for sponsorship based on salary and skills shortage list
5/26/22, 8:11 PM - +234 813 882 2739: Meanwhile some top organizations don’t even care if you need sponsorship. Target organizations like Accenture, big 4 etc. They sponsor from the graduate level upwards
5/26/22, 8:12 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay
5/26/22, 8:14 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hmmm i think for Big 4, its very easy from big 4 here to big 4 there. Not so sure how easy it is for anyone who hasn't worked in a big 4 here.

5/27/22, 10:37 AM - +234 703 160 7868: Will you be able to attend meetings at unholy hours of the night?👀 If yes, start by aligning with a party of your preference. Reach out to your ward chairman and register as a member of the participant. Position yourself as a financial party member and sponsor a candidate of your choice by bankrolling their election bid at least from ward councilor level. Stamp your influence by making things happen within and outside the party. After doing the above, by the next election cycle, it's the party that will even offer you the delegate position.

I was scheduled for Tuesday 11am.  I got there 30min with an assumption that since I’ve done the online initial registration it shouldn’t be stressful again. I got in and I was told i’m number 250. Seeing the pool of crowd I gave up and went home. If you have a day you won’t be working you can sacrifice that.

5/27/22, 12:16 PM - +234 703 160 7868: It is plenty! But one of the obvious as already mentioned earlier by someone is that you'll be getting lots of free dollars with little or no sweat. As a party chieftain, you're amongst a privileged few that will decide the fate of millions of Nigerians by your choice of party candidate - which can spell either good or evil for all of us👿 (An example is Buhari). You'll also be influential in deciding who gets what when it comes to govt appointments and positions. To a reasonable extent, you'll also enjoy unhindered access to the seat of power (don't even know if this can be seen as a flex of sort). Even though all of these might come at the detriment of the country's progress. So do we come together to demand an overhaul of the party delegate system?💀 If we must defeat these people and all the issues bedeviling our country since 1960, then we all must do the needful. Otherwise we'll never see an end to the japa tales here and there.

5/27/22, 12:55 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Guess the most important thing thing is to be "spiritual"  ( whatever spirituality means to you ) not  " religious" 


🧐
5/27/22, 12:57 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I have held leadership positions, right from secondary school..but when it came to University, I deter myself.  Was more focused on "books" 🤥...
5/27/22, 12:58 PM - +234 818 415 3106: That is where the game is
5/27/22, 1:04 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Lol...you're right! I see myself as more of a spiritual than a religious person.
5/27/22, 1:05 PM - +234 703 160 7868: This one is very important too.😤
5/27/22, 1:06 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah.. Exactly .

5/27/22, 1:09 PM - +234 818 415 3106: You and who abeg, that life have been left behind with uni
5/27/22, 1:10 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Can't continue saying "it's a dirty game" whereas your future and destiny is is been decided for
5/27/22, 1:11 PM - +234 706 439 6712: So to the Japaa is the best option for u abi ?
5/27/22, 1:11 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I keep asking myself if all of us Jappa finish... In the 30-50 years time, do we think we will still have a country called "Nigeria " ?
5/27/22, 1:13 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yes. . Japaa.. Get a better life... Get more funds.. Enjoy yourself n ur family.... But for how long? 


How about the destiny of your children, and generations to come?
5/27/22, 1:13 PM - +234 703 678 8365: You underestimate the population of your beloved country Nigeria. Not even a fraction of this population can japa due to how uneasy it is to actually japa (I mean the proper way).
5/27/22, 1:17 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Destiny?? 😅😅. You people should take it easy. Whether in Nigeria or anywhere else, a natural order of things will follow. 

Nigeria is not the only place you can call home. Other places can become your home too. Like I said, not everyone can and will japa, no matter how trendy the topic may seem.
5/27/22, 1:17 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Not like every single one of us will Jappa.. I know that's not possible... But check the stats and rates at which "Youths", which accounts for more than 65% of our population, are " Japparing"
5/27/22, 1:19 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Who did the survey and research that you drew this your notions from. Japa is only trendy. Don't be swayed by the buzz.
5/27/22, 1:23 PM - +234 703 678 8365: During the times of my parents, Switzerland was donning out fully funded scholarships as well as some other countries that even led to permanent migration. During the time of my uncles, Ireland was massive on immigration and there was also a buzz word for it back then(can't remember). Often times, period of mass migration happens but I can say for a fact that people(youths in this case) can never be short of supply in Nigeria.

After some critical reasoning, about everything, I came to a conclusion that "No man owns nowhere, in the universe " .   But natural habitation has made us believe that Nigeria or another place you might have found yourself, is the only place you can call home..to the extend will kill and die for our lands or the said natural habitation .
5/27/22, 1:52 PM - +234 909 130 5248: KMeans clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to group “data points” together into groups by calculating “centroids” or center points where other data points that are closer to the centroids are grouped with that centroid
5/27/22, 1:55 PM - +234 909 130 5248: This is an example 

We have the whole of Ibadan as a big space (without the houses or anything, just a very very big land) filled with people on different points. Now we want to group the people using properties like “old”, “rich”, “healthy”, and the likes. To actually know these groups, we need to first calculate the positions of the most “old”, most “rich”, and most “healthy” among the people in the space. Calculating this allows us to zero in on the number of groups we want

Afterwards, the distance between each data point and each of the centroids is calculated, and the smallest distance out of the calculated ones is attached to a centroid, and thus belongs to that “cluster”

I believe this does it

5/27/22, 6:08 PM - +234 816 484 7452: If I am a newbie ehn,

I will go to a funny remote place and do intensive self development for 6 months

After that I go do 6 months unpaid internship 

Then come out of it and start billing 500K 🤣😂
5/27/22, 6:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: How many years do you have as an Accountant?
5/27/22, 6:09 PM - +234 808 339 2756: 5 years
5/27/22, 6:09 PM - +234 808 339 2756: I am also qualified (ICAN)
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Guys on Politics

Is it true Tinubu is being disqualified from APC due to some issues and baba is moving to SDP
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - +234 803 353 6901: *One of our Boss Don Born for here* 

😌😌😌
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Hmmm

Why do you want to switch entirely though? It’s not impossible but just looking at the options
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: who is following that gist here
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - +234 803 353 6901: 🤔🤔
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: <Media omitted>
5/27/22, 6:10 PM - +234 802 755 7589: I think it’s all rumor
5/27/22, 6:11 PM - +234 816 484 7452: We have super stars and strikers here 😌

You can’t tell me otherwise
5/27/22, 6:11 PM - +234 803 353 6901: If you don't Gerrit, forget about it 😂😌
5/27/22, 6:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Going the route of Citizen Analyst looks to be the option I would recommend as against a complete transitioning. 

You have years of experience a fresh graduate with just Data skills can’t have
5/27/22, 6:11 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Ehn ehn
5/27/22, 6:12 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Omoooo

Na the future of Nigeria those guys Dey use play like this 😞
5/27/22, 6:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: @2348083392756
5/27/22, 6:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Complete transitioning might be challenging and breaking in with the saturation in the space for new joiners will also be daunting. 

Like I said it’s not impossible really, I’m only recommending an option I believe will give you a leverage and your existing experience will still be vital.
5/27/22, 6:14 PM - +234 808 339 2756: Thanks boss. I get your point. Dey no get Finance Data Analyts ni?
5/27/22, 6:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Your resume will them Finance + Data or Account + Data.
5/27/22, 6:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: A Data Analyst in the Finance space is different from a Finance professional with an analytics skill.
5/27/22, 6:15 PM - +234 803 353 6901: <Media omitted>
5/27/22, 6:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The later is what I think will be more appropriate for you. But if you think a full transitioning is what will be best for you that’s also possible. 

Get started with the right resources and start learning.
5/27/22, 6:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: A good resource. 

For a newbie in Nigeria just go with the tools for the Nigerian market to get a job first 😂. 

Once you have that job you can start upskilling to eye the international market
5/27/22, 6:18 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Exactly.
5/27/22, 6:22 PM - +234 806 347 2085: I have alot of questions on this upskilling to get something in the international market cos it seems I am eyeing the market prematurely
5/27/22, 6:23 PM - +234 808 339 2756: Thanks, boss. Let me think this through again and know what's next. You did Justice to so many what-ifs I have been brooding over.
5/27/22, 6:23 PM - +234 818 415 3106: Shoot
5/27/22, 6:24 PM - +234 808 339 2756: Thanks boss
5/27/22, 6:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Shoot your questions 

Don’t eye the international space when you never even have grip of the local market 😂
5/27/22, 6:26 PM - +234 806 347 2085: After looking at the different parts of data, analytics engineering pricked my interest. I am currently an intern and I don't know of  it's wise starting to transition into analytics engineering or concentrate and get a job as a data analyst first of all. I know analytics engineering is quite new to the Nigerian market. Also I have applied to international Jobs and I don chop breakfast tire. I feel I need to calm down small and maybe work in a full-time role as a data analyst first. It's looking like I am trying to run faster then my shadows
5/27/22, 6:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The international market is very challenging because it’s a global competition na why we dey chop steady breakfast. 

So first get a Data job here to gain that experience before you start thinking of upskiling for the international market.
5/27/22, 6:28 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Alright
5/27/22, 6:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I answered that already. 

Calm down. 

Get a Data job here first to learn and build experience atleast 1-2 years before you start eyeing FX 😂
5/27/22, 6:29 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Alright
5/27/22, 6:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No doubt there may be some exceptions. 

Learn data for 3-6 months here then japa using Grad school or any option 😂
5/27/22, 6:31 PM - +234 806 347 2085: But what of Upwork? I seem not to have cracked it. Getting a data gig is quite difficult there. This is for side hustle. Bills gats be paid. Please any pointers on how to write a proposal that will not be ignored
5/27/22, 6:31 PM - +234 806 347 2085: 🤣🤣
5/27/22, 6:31 PM - +234 706 439 6712: <Media omitted>
5/27/22, 6:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na the surest option be this if you ask me 😂
5/27/22, 6:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omoo I don’t understand the freelance space.  Maybe others can answer. 

My interest never piqued towards the freelancing route.
5/27/22, 6:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly 
Learn data here
Work small with it
Japa 
Turn to international star over there
5/27/22, 6:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: My strategy right from time has been, first get a job to pay bills make sapa won’t finish you. Then while at the job invest in self development and upskill yourself to start applying for jobs low key while at the job.
5/27/22, 6:35 PM - +234 806 347 2085: This sounds good too
5/27/22, 6:36 PM - +234 806 347 2085: This is a good plan too cos sapa is real
5/27/22, 6:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Very real oo
5/27/22, 6:37 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Upwork is somehow sha.. I've used it for a little  over a year now.. 

One secret is if you can sign up using locations like USA, Canada, UK, e.t.c you'd bag more gigs than using Nigeria.. I don't know how they do this tho.

Not kidding, a friend did that and she's bagged over $3k..

Then with that, you can package it as "rendering analytics services for over X international clients..."
5/27/22, 6:38 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Nigeria is a ~course~ 


🤥
5/27/22, 6:38 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know people cash out from freelancing. It’s not just my thing.
5/27/22, 6:38 PM - +234 706 439 6712: My anger keeps growing, every day
5/27/22, 6:39 PM - +234 806 347 2085: I heard this before and didn't believe it. I guess it's true
5/27/22, 6:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I tried upwork then but mehn ko easy pitching for project 😂
5/27/22, 6:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂
5/27/22, 6:39 PM - +234 806 347 2085: It is difficult
5/27/22, 6:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na why I free am 😂
5/27/22, 6:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Though I was doing training as side gig then sha
5/27/22, 6:40 PM - +234 809 183 1446: If you're going to use Nigeria, swallow the urge to bag big at once and slash the estimated price by 50%.

You might get lucky and those clients leave your contract open.
5/27/22, 6:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Academy never plenty like this then 😂
5/27/22, 6:41 PM - +234 706 439 6712: U go learn finish, gather sufficient experience,  package urself see better offer...once they realize say be Nigeria.


Oyo is ur case 🤥🤕🤣
5/27/22, 6:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
5/27/22, 6:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: May Nigeria not happen to us 😂
5/27/22, 6:41 PM - +234 809 183 1446: 😂😂 omoo, one of my guys legit sent "I'll do this for you, check out my portfolio" and he got the contract.
5/27/22, 6:41 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Amen
5/27/22, 6:41 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Amen oooo
5/27/22, 6:42 PM - +234 816 398 2854: 🤲😭🤲
5/27/22, 6:42 PM - +234 806 347 2085: OMOO*1000
5/27/22, 6:42 PM - +234 706 439 6712: As if it's a bad tin to be a Nigerian...
5/27/22, 6:43 PM - +234 706 439 6712: We don too get bad records...



Our politicians n Yahoo boys don spoil tinz
5/27/22, 6:44 PM - +234 806 347 2085: It looks like it's a bad thing in this present dispensation
5/27/22, 6:46 PM - +234 902 586 7272: 👏🏾
5/27/22, 6:47 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/27/22, 6:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s why I freed freelancing then. I don’t have the strength
5/27/22, 6:50 PM - +234 809 183 1446: 😂😂

My first client on Upwork posted a gig for $100 

I submitted my proposal for $40.. Baba rushed me.. at the end I made over $200 from him 😂
5/27/22, 6:50 PM - +234 810 258 9896: Nigeria is not a curse, location is always a barrier for freelancers (Nigeria or not).

Sell what is not common or hard you will know Nigeria is not a curse, people will come for you, just make sure they can find you.
5/27/22, 6:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nice nice 😊
5/27/22, 6:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: We don suffer for this 9ja 😂
5/27/22, 6:51 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Ur right , sir

5/27/22, 9:52 PM - +234 703 845 5619: I believe AE role is beyond "writing SQL" and requires more thought than using already prepared data to provide insights. 

As an illustration, I would say AE decides what to cook, goes shopping for ingredients, prepare the ingredients and then Analysts use the ingredients to prepare a sumptuous meal. 

But the Analyst is limited to the thought process behind the AE choice of meal and ingredients.

5/28/22, 5:47 PM - +234 903 783 8682: How untrue is it?
5/28/22, 5:48 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I think it's the way you have looked at it
5/28/22, 5:48 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I do.

I know R lovers will never agree. But I'm not the first to say this.
5/28/22, 5:48 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I have a lot of people who don't even know about programming that picked up R and found it interesting
5/28/22, 5:48 PM - +234 812 091 9501: In my opinion, I think it's more intuitive than Python
5/28/22, 5:49 PM - +234 903 783 8682: They found it interesting because they've never learnt another language before it.
5/28/22, 5:49 PM - +234 903 783 8682: NEVER. EVER.
5/28/22, 5:49 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Exactly! All what you will say will be from a biased view
5/28/22, 5:49 PM - +234 903 783 8682: For example, what data structure is a vector?
5/28/22, 5:50 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I also have a lot of people that have learnt other languages and found it interesting

At least @2349096816401 is one of them
5/28/22, 5:50 PM - +234 903 783 8682: And it has very annoying package names like ggplot, dplyr and all sorts of unfriendly names.
5/28/22, 5:50 PM - +234 812 091 9501: A vector can store different data types.. Numeric, character etc
5/28/22, 5:50 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I know. But it has no equivalent in other languages.
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Bro.. I will pass on this argument... Your issues with R is clear
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 812 091 9501: My oga dey vex for package name
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Ahh, please o

Not my ggplot2
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂
How package namd take concern wetin R wan do
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Thank you. 😅
5/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Why did sir Benny bring up this argument
5/28/22, 5:52 PM - +234 706 439 6712: hahaha this baba has special hatred for R .  MAKA Y?
5/28/22, 5:52 PM - +234 812 091 9501: There are currently over 14k packages to do anything you want to do with data and all
5/28/22, 5:52 PM - +234 909 248 3462: I thought we were told not to be tool biased
5/28/22, 5:52 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂
5/28/22, 5:52 PM - +234 904 894 6475: That's exactly the non-intuitiveness @2349037838682 is talking about 😂

Why design a data structure like this and call it a vector? 🙆🏽‍♂️
5/28/22, 5:53 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I am telling you
5/28/22, 5:53 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Actually, I see it as more of a learning discussion but everyone will hold to their bias sha 😂
5/28/22, 5:53 PM - +234 814 671 1306: This message was deleted
5/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Send us the food too @2348146711306
5/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🌚
5/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 814 671 1306: It was a mistake😂
5/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I was actually first introduced to Spss n R by one my stat. lecturers  , back den in school...but to be honest , even as a stat student , i didn't really it cool
5/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Through though learnt a lot from people's opinion
5/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I know the issue
5/28/22, 5:55 PM - +234 812 091 9501: It's the way people learnt R
5/28/22, 5:55 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I also had a similar experience @2347064396712 but I learnt it myself and I have taught a lot of people R
5/28/22, 5:56 PM - +234 706 439 6712: i soon discovered python n Julia ..... n tend to love , even more
5/28/22, 5:56 PM - +234 809 183 1446: If you're looking at R as Base R only, you might not enjoy it.. but if you've used packages around the tidyverse eco system.. you'd really enjoy working with R

That's how I see it sha
5/28/22, 5:56 PM - +234 814 669 0593: This is a fallacy 😄
5/28/22, 5:56 PM - +234 812 091 9501: <Media omitted>
5/28/22, 5:56 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Well.. That's my opinion

I have used both well
5/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly...

If you learn R with Base R, you will be bitter 😂
5/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I started with Python self.. But I found R more interesting
5/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Ah swear.. Tidyverse eco system changed a lot of things
5/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Maybe that's why I think it's intuitive
5/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Your course? Like you were the tutor
5/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I still enjoyed Base tho.

When I learn tidyverse, omoo I was blown.

We were all excited. @2347033167142, @2347068709716 and I.
5/28/22, 5:58 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Yeah 
You know a lot of universities still force their student to learn R right?
5/28/22, 5:58 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Its for learning , man . purely so
5/28/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Tidyverse makes life so so easy
5/28/22, 5:58 PM - +234 814 669 0593: True
5/28/22, 5:58 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Imagine spicing things with Shiny, Targets, and co 😩😩🥺
5/28/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 091 9501: It depends on the department and what they need it for

The problem is many of those lecturers don't even know R well... They have not used it well
5/28/22, 5:59 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😭😭😭
5/28/22, 5:59 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I can literally build a website with Shiny
5/28/22, 5:59 PM - +234 809 183 1446: It's a web framework already😅
5/28/22, 5:59 PM - +234 809 183 1446: You should check out Rhino
5/28/22, 6:00 PM - +234 812 091 9501: So so bitter...
The way I teach R is that..

After the first 3 meeting, by the 4th meeting, I don expose students to Tidyverse
5/28/22, 6:00 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ikr... I remember R conference last year...

Come and see R Shiny, spiced up with JS, HTML and CSS.
5/28/22, 6:00 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Actually most of them know R more than python
5/28/22, 6:00 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I have not used R and I believe R is great at what it does. But I think for people who have a more programming/SWE background, it's easier to be more biased towards Python when you compare the two, and rightly so. R is more stats and computational science focused. And this extreme focus makes it so efficient.
5/28/22, 6:00 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Haa.. Let me check it out
5/28/22, 6:00 PM - +234 809 183 1446: 🥺
5/28/22, 6:01 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Abeg don't intimidate us with shiny.

When Django comes with batteries.
And flask can create a web page with few lines of code.
5/28/22, 6:01 PM - +234 812 091 9501: My brother.. Anytime I want to fantasize at the beauty of R and Shiny.. I just go to the R shiny webiste to see people's work
5/28/22, 6:01 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂
5/28/22, 6:01 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🫡
5/28/22, 6:01 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Have you used Django,  Flask, FastAPI before?
5/28/22, 6:02 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Thank you Zion. This is a balanced view

In all, before taking on a new programming language, there are things you should consider including whether it has a great community and support system
5/28/22, 6:03 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Yesh.. But some can't teach it

I remember when I was still in Nigeria.. One of my daddys in Computer science asked me to come teach his year 3 students R..
5/28/22, 6:05 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Yeah.. I work with Coursera to create project based courses

Currently at about 21k learners in all. 

Funnily, it seems like I am the only one that teach R extensively.

Another funny is that most people just started learning R

I noticed that my SQL and Power BI courses has more learners
5/28/22, 6:06 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂🤣
5/28/22, 6:06 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Thank God you agree to that

A simple function can save you from writing 10 lines of codes
5/28/22, 6:06 PM - +234 904 894 6475: R has been more native to the academic science community. Python only in recent years started gaining traction with the vast majority of the science community after its lauded success in areas like CS & machine learning research.

So a lot of universities still using R now is more of long-time familiarity. I don't see R dying off anytime soon but I see Python dominating in universities by a large margin, especially as younger academics emerge. Even in the social sciences!
5/28/22, 6:07 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Wow... I must check out your course
5/28/22, 6:07 PM - +234 812 091 9501: @2347033167142 na Tidyverse boss 😂😂

Na my oga be that
5/28/22, 6:08 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Is it possible that while working on a project u use both R and python
5/28/22, 6:08 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Yea
5/28/22, 6:08 PM - +234 814 669 0593: But simple things get complicated too.

Example,  managing dependencies  or installing library of a particular version or multiple libraries using different version of a dependent libraries and there is lack of backward compatibility
5/28/22, 6:09 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I will say R appeals more to the academic community while Python has more commercial relevance. if it is about statistical analysis and statistical packages, R definitely wins. But for industry grade solutions and commercial appeal, python wins. People in industry use R but very few when compared to Python. In the academic community, it is the reverse. 
I prefer Python personally because it is an all purpose language. It is versatile, robust and flexible.
5/28/22, 6:09 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Especially that FastAPI 🥰
5/28/22, 6:09 PM - +234 812 091 9501: R cannot die off definitely

You know why?

We will have data needs.. We will keep having computational needs

And you will agree with me that R provides handy solutions to these needs more efficiently through dedicated packages that people have written to solve these needs
5/28/22, 6:10 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
5/28/22, 6:10 PM - +234 812 091 9501: @2349037838682.. You should check out R

You are a geo scientist.. 

It will save you a lot of stress

There are lots and lots of R packages that can help you solve problems
5/28/22, 6:11 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Guy's let's endeavour to not start a Python/R war 😂

Although if we have to, and especially if we are looking at connecting data projects to business success, I don't see the chance R has here. I'm sorry 🤲🏽
5/28/22, 6:12 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Another balanced view
5/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Python has no shortage of geo packages.
5/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 812 091 9501: You people in the industry stick with your Python

Those of us in the academics, we will stick with our R 😂
5/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂😂
5/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 814 669 0593: One of the main reasons for this is the ease of writing a research paper, statistical outputs,  and adding a bibliography to the paper directly using Rstudio.

For analysis and technical functionality,  there is hardly what you can do with R that you can't do or create a tool to do it in python.
5/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 706 439 6712: God bless u o .. u will live long
5/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂
5/28/22, 6:14 PM - +234 903 783 8682: R doesn't use zero indexing.

I just remembered this.
5/28/22, 6:14 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Getting almost everything in one place is bae
5/28/22, 6:14 PM - +234 706 439 6712: *DONE
5/28/22, 6:14 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Like @2348108522573 will always say, when we need to use a tool, we can easily pick it up

That's the sweet part
5/28/22, 6:14 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Yes
5/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂

You just don't like R, it's clear
5/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I agree with this
5/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 904 894 6475: You are right. Despite not having used R, I know how efficient it is for data-specific purposes. So it's definitely not going anywhere.

I'm a Pythonista and really would not like to touch R for any project, but if there's a potentially impactful project that requires me to use R, and I ultimately have to, then I would definitely go for it.
5/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 703 678 8365: My first experience doing geospatial analysis with R was a disaster thoe. Very slow regardless of system specs and inefficient as compared to the regular geospatial softwares in the industry. 

I was eager to see a programming alternative but was deflated and dissapointed to say the least.
5/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Sure na.

Academia people are uncool people.

It's only normal for their tools to be uncool.

They have no reason to simplify things, unlike industry folks who have customers to please.
5/28/22, 6:16 PM - +234 812 091 9501: That's the sweet part... When you need a tool for anything, pick it up
🤝🏾
5/28/22, 6:16 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Now, I like how you have put it 😂. The key thing here is in realising the domain where each tool has the unparalleled advantage.
5/28/22, 6:16 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂

@2349037838682 just leave me already 😂😂
5/28/22, 6:16 PM - +234 706 439 6712: hahahah   shinny shiny o my dear shinny
5/28/22, 6:17 PM - +234 812 091 9501: He say we are uncool people
5/28/22, 6:17 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🤝🏾

Plus yoy should check out R one of these days
5/28/22, 6:17 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Really? Okay, my chances of ever touching R just started approaching zero asymptotically 🤣

No, just kidding 🤭
5/28/22, 6:17 PM - +234 809 183 1446: I wish someone like Matt Dancho was here to convert "O ye Pythonistas" 😂
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: @2348168847243 I think you should add a thought or 2
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: They plenty pass us for here na why
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: If Matt dey herr 😂😂
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 706 439 6712: To be honest , guys . i don't know much in R sha .. but i will learn n master it . ii will need it for computation intensive projects , soon
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I wish to like it actually.

I used to hate CSS and JavaScript until I met freecodecamp.

Perhaps, one day I'll find a platform that will make R enticing.

But for now, it's py all the way.
5/28/22, 6:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: We shall wait for you then 😂😂
5/28/22, 6:19 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🤝🏾
5/28/22, 6:19 PM - +234 706 439 6712: hahahah
5/28/22, 6:19 PM - +234 812 091 9501: R is actually cool to be honest
5/28/22, 6:19 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Computational intensive project,  don't bother with R.

Numpy is enough for you .
5/28/22, 6:20 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Numpy of cpython.
5/28/22, 6:20 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I think someone who have used both well will have a more balanced opinion

Like @2347033167142
5/28/22, 6:20 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Speed of flash.
5/28/22, 6:21 PM - +234 809 183 1446: But, R's presence outside academia is increasing tho..

I saw an Amazon Job posting for Shiny Developers
5/28/22, 6:21 PM - +234 812 091 9501: <Media omitted>
5/28/22, 6:21 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I look at R code sometimes and I get sore eyes 😂

Perhaps it's because I don't look at it from the approach of trying to figure it out. Sometimes I just want to look at a piece of code and understand what is going on by its syntax. I hated JavaScript for failing at this, until I eventually got used to its syntax. Who knows, I might take interest in R some day too 😅
5/28/22, 6:21 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Thanks for the reminder.
5/28/22, 6:22 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Just attend one Data Science Hangout meeting and see where people are applying R in.
5/28/22, 6:22 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Link
5/28/22, 6:22 PM - +234 903 783 8682: JavaScript is still an annoying language though. 

Maybe python has just made me a spoilt brat.

5/28/22, 6:23 PM - +234 706 439 6712: 👍
5/28/22, 6:23 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I am telling you

R is super cool
5/28/22, 6:23 PM - +234 903 783 8682: 👍🏾
5/28/22, 6:23 PM - +234 706 439 6712: ok boss
5/28/22, 6:24 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂

It different when you look at something with the heart to solve a problem
5/28/22, 6:24 PM - +234 814 669 0593: I attended one. I was bored. 

A lot of R users still act like we are in the age of kilobyte data
5/28/22, 6:25 PM - +234 903 783 8682: 😬
5/28/22, 6:26 PM - +234 809 183 1446: lol, when was that?
5/28/22, 6:29 PM - +234 814 669 0593: I can't even remember,  maybe during the lockdown or so.
5/28/22, 6:29 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I think that's one of the dangers of learning Python as the first language. It's ease of learning comes at the expense of some classical programming customs. Many of us are victims of this. I started with C++, around 2013, although I struggled with it. But it made it a little easier to approach other languages after learning and getting used to Python. Take away that little C++ background and I would have a lot of trouble reading code in other prominent high-level languages.
5/28/22, 6:30 PM - +234 909 248 3462: Be like say u be former unilag student
5/28/22, 6:30 PM - +234 906 092 6282: This is a scarilege on the R programming language I must say
5/28/22, 6:30 PM - +234 809 183 1446: 😅 I started attending their meetings early this year sha.. and so far, it's been interesting.
5/28/22, 6:30 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I have four certificates in R. One from edX and three from DataCamp.

You know when you carry last in road rash and they tell you "at least you managed to finish the sucker".
5/28/22, 6:31 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Another myth about R
5/28/22, 6:32 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Have you tried learning R from tidytuesday?
5/28/22, 6:32 PM - +234 906 092 6282: If you work with R extensively, you will appreciate its power and functionalities in many ways
5/28/22, 6:33 PM - +234 906 092 6282: If you've not been exposed to R at all, then you may have many wrong notion about the Language, in all use the tools that works best for you.
5/28/22, 6:34 PM - +234 906 092 6282: *notions
5/28/22, 6:36 PM - +234 904 894 6475: That's a false positive @2349092483462. Curious to know why you thought so 😂
5/28/22, 6:36 PM - +234 909 248 3462: My bad.... just normal Unilag routine to introduce u to c++
5/28/22, 6:37 PM - +234 903 783 8682: No.

I'll try it out

5/28/22, 6:39 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Oh, interesting
5/28/22, 6:40 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Thank you sir!
5/28/22, 6:41 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🤝🏾
5/28/22, 6:41 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🤝🏾
5/28/22, 6:42 PM - +234 812 091 9501: We need to be more open minded about tools
5/28/22, 6:45 PM - +234 903 783 8682: True.

I learnt this last year. I've always been a stark antagonist of ESRI tools until last year when a client insisted on it.

I had to learn it. And wow, I'm loving the ease that comes with it. So many ready made, plug-and-play tools.

You can easily build your website with WordPress and embed your dashboard and map there.
5/28/22, 6:48 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Beautiful submission
5/28/22, 6:54 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Same thing with cloud platforms. Do you know many people who do data science/eng on cloud are mostly biased towards any of AWS, Azure or GCP?

I started to use Oracle Cloud in 2020 and I was deeply amazed by its vast functionalities and flexibility for data science and DataOps. Most importantly, the data UX is something else. The truth is, just because something isn't popular doesn't mean it can't deliver or even outperform the popular ones. This is why in this data space, you have to constantly update yourself and get familiar with a vast array of tools. Otherwise you get outdated. It is true that we don't need to jump at every new tool, and even if we wanted, where's the time? However, just getting familiar with the various innovations in data science tooling and infrastructure would suffice.
5/28/22, 6:54 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽
5/28/22, 6:57 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Another thing I learnt is, when you really need a tool, you'll find a way to learn it within a short time. That's as long as you learnt the fundamentals.

Early this year, I applied for a software developer role. The prerequisite was to build a graphql API and consume it with a react front end.

It was the first time I heard of graphql. Yet I was able to complete the challenge within five days.
5/28/22, 6:57 PM - +234 706 439 6712: i am here, already . i love what am seeing
5/28/22, 6:59 PM - +234 812 091 9501: We are live. You can join in now.
5/28/22, 6:59 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Keyword: getting familiar with as many tools as possible.

Thanks so much.

5/28/22, 9:44 PM - +234 703 316 7142: What can be more intuitive please??
5/28/22, 9:46 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You guys are just been ridiculous
5/28/22, 9:46 PM - +234 903 905 0643: R advocate
5/28/22, 9:47 PM - +234 706 439 6712: 🤣🤣
5/28/22, 9:47 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I didnt even see this before...

I learnt Python before R. R was more intuitive for me... Especially because I was a Stats person
5/28/22, 9:47 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Baba don land.



A die-hard fan of R.
5/28/22, 9:48 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Anyone that has worked with excel can work very well with R
5/28/22, 9:50 PM - +234 703 316 7142: It uses that concept of mathematics, function of functions just like excel and can also work in similar directions just like Python using the likes Tidyverse
5/28/22, 9:51 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Exactly..
5/28/22, 9:51 PM - +234 903 905 0643: Exactly, 

R was literally easier to pick it felt more stats than python
5/28/22, 9:52 PM - +234 703 316 7142: The only reason this will be true is because you started off working with Python which is totally understandable but don't generalize this for every other person
5/28/22, 9:53 PM - +234 809 183 1446: My ogah don come 🤲🏼
5/28/22, 9:53 PM - +234 812 091 9501: We don line up for his back
5/28/22, 9:58 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Using pipe (%>%)can be addictive 🥺
5/28/22, 9:58 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Ctrl M
5/28/22, 10:05 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I have worked with both R and Python, and I started with Python. I will tell you categorically now that R is far intuitive than Python. 

Agree or you agree. Python can be better in general but Intuitive? Python is no closer to intuitive boss.
5/28/22, 10:07 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Matt Dancho would argue that R is good for production self.

And theres SparkR 🤟🏾
5/28/22, 10:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You no dey watch hall
5/28/22, 10:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *ball
5/28/22, 10:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This man you too like work 😂😂
5/28/22, 10:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Better go find babe
5/28/22, 10:09 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Sparklyr*
5/28/22, 10:09 PM - +234 809 183 1446: @2347033167142 you remember?
5/28/22, 10:10 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Wow! So libraries like pandas and numpy is what makes sense to you right? Me seeing pandas sounds like it's used for dataframes and arrays from onset?
5/28/22, 10:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Na R and Python una dey argue about
5/28/22, 10:11 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Chai
5/28/22, 10:11 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I am telling them.. R is super intuitive
5/28/22, 10:11 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂😂😂
5/28/22, 10:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2347033167142
5/28/22, 10:12 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Me I dey watch ball sha
5/28/22, 10:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Interswitch don give you policy that will allow you take care of the babe.
5/28/22, 10:12 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Because Vector does not have a similarity compared to other languages makes R bad?? Vector is the most simplest and efficient data structure that anyone can ever work it in any programming language and it's bad that we don't have such in python.
5/28/22, 10:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Python has better data structures compared to R o, I don't doubt that but vector at it's simplest? Python doesn't have that🤷🏼‍♂️
5/28/22, 10:15 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I agree less with this boss
5/28/22, 10:16 PM - +234 904 894 6475: We actually have vectors in Python. They are just not called vectors. Numpy has really sophisticated capabilities for linear algebra, inspired from MATLAB.
5/28/22, 10:16 PM - +234 703 316 7142: How does this matter here God😭😭
5/28/22, 10:16 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 😂
5/28/22, 10:17 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Thank you for the correction... I kuku nevr use am before.
5/28/22, 10:17 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Yeah.. To an extend

The arguemnt is that Python is more useful for production
5/28/22, 10:17 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea... that's it.

R is memory intensive. 😬
5/28/22, 10:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
5/28/22, 10:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Which kind response be this 😂
5/28/22, 10:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: That's why I said @2347033167142 will have a more balanced view
5/28/22, 10:18 PM - +234 812 091 9501: He has used the two well
5/28/22, 10:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Una still dey argue R vs Python for this age
5/28/22, 10:19 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I dey tell you..

@2349037838682 even dey vex for our package name 😂
5/28/22, 10:19 PM - +234 703 316 7142: My Oga🙇🏽‍♂️
5/28/22, 10:19 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Not really arguing but clearing some myths
5/28/22, 10:19 PM - +234 703 316 7142: They can't understand
5/28/22, 10:19 PM - +234 809 183 1446: As Matt Dancho would say, it's no longer R vs Python.. it's now R and Python
5/28/22, 10:20 PM - +234 703 316 7142: What are they called boss??
5/28/22, 10:20 PM - +234 816 398 2854: 😂😂😂

🤥
5/28/22, 10:22 PM - +234 816 484 7452: At least your babe go dey your DM right now if football no gel

5/28/22, 10:23 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Nah, Julia is still young for this particular one. I feel we'd be able to do Julia vs R or Python in the next 2 years.
5/28/22, 10:23 PM - +234 816 484 7452: There are ladies here

5/28/22, 10:27 PM - +234 904 894 6475: In the near future, Julia will beat R in many use cases arms down (or my opinion? 🤔). It's getting a lot of visibility in the academic community too. It also offers efficiency that outmatches Python in many computational problems. It may not beat Python roundly as it is not OOP, but this is arguable.
5/28/22, 10:27 PM - +234 706 439 6712: They looked married to me. .

Does it mean one will need to create a list of the names and then use the df.column function or Is there any other shortcut?
5/28/22, 11:36 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Just do df.columns and you get the list of all your columns, you can copy that, edit it and use df.columns = the new edited list

5/29/22, 12:32 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Numpy 1-dimensional arrays are vectors. You can implement all the mathematical notions of vector operations on them. Numpy also implements standard linear algebra operations between vectors (1-D arrays) and matrices (2-D arrays). The entire suite of scalar products, vector products, matrix multiplication, Hadarmad product, linear transformations, etc.

Also, all 2D arrays in Python are matrices, although numpy still has the "matrix" as a special data structure that allows you apply more specific operations.

Just had to point out what vectors actually are in Python, in response to your question. Many times, we get so used to the array terminology, that we forget they can be different things (vectors, matrices or tensors).

I'm not really interested in the Python/R argument. As I established earlier, I use whatever gets the job done most efficiently, based on the use case 😉

Simple is always better, and scenario analysis definitely works for these cases.

The 2 approaches of ML and causal inference are just like going the extra mile and seeing how to further enhance decision quality. But certainly, the most reasonable thing a data scientist would do is to start with analytics.
5/29/22, 3:14 PM - +234 818 047 2075: So for numbe one, I will find out the profitability of that segment (revenue minus cost to serve) based on historical info. Then setup forecasts Based on 3 scenarios above
5/29/22, 3:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s actually subjective 😂

It can be approached based on some assumptions. 

Less could be more. Simplistic solution might generate better value.
5/29/22, 3:22 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Thank you.

Do you mind sharing how ML or causal inference will solved this. I like this because it is not the traditional ML usecase we see around.
5/29/22, 3:25 PM - +234 904 894 6475: My reasoning for setting up the problem like this is that they are posed to data scientists, so modelling.

But if the same questions are posed to data or business analysts, the expected approach will be different.
5/29/22, 3:25 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes I will boss 😅
Just want to get some more answers first
5/29/22, 3:32 PM - +234 904 894 6475: By the way, I'm basing these questions on metrics of employee performance. Trying not to distort the original wording of the questions because that alone could change how to approach each of them. But let's just say in both cases the dependent variable is employee outcomes (or performance)
5/29/22, 3:34 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Ok great 🙏

5/29/22, 10:17 PM - +234 813 774 1580: If I'm to give you an answer because you want one then, number 1 can be predictive approach and number 2 can be causal inference approach. The reason is that number 2 seems to depend on factors about the employees work experience and track records. Therefore we can adopt an improve baye's theorem referred to as Causal Calculus, e.g The probability that employee should gain subsidy because they spent this x-years and the salary is below NGNy. The  EDA will tell if the approach is less costly compare to number 1. But number 1 is more of how the historically employed college graduates have succeeded and also benefits the company, thereby taking a look at predicting the churn rate and the cost of retaining them over the same period as number 2.

In summary, DS problems are not always straight forward but then, a stakeholder who has no idea is requesting for a straight forward answer. A lot about the problem statement is tied to the 'why?'.
This 'why?' comes with 'what? Where? and when?'; which I believe EDA will tell you. The how is the implementation which comes last.

#You_too_talk_own
5/29/22, 10:27 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The answer to this is that they are both causal inference problems. They are both problems that answer yes or no, either of which require evidentiary support because they are decision choices. Machine learning would not suffice to approach those questions, at least not in the way they were posed. The questions were posed as decision questions. The answer must be a single, justified, decision response. 

A prediction problem will look something like "Are college graduates better employees (by job performance or other metric)? Then we can go into historical data and use machine learning to capture the relationship between observatory variables and outcomes. Machine learning uses correlation to make predictions. But the model doesn't guarantee there's causation. The original question 1 is not asking if college graduates will be better, it's asking if the decision to hire college graduates is right. It's asking for cause and effect. The response must describe a policy that supports the relationship between the decision (not the variables) and the outcome. The model that will achieve this must infer what the cause-and-effect policy is.

For the rephrased question, machine learning will produce knowledge that asserts the likelihood of your decision quality being high, should you make the decision based on some metric. The likelihood is never a 100%. For the original questions, however, causal inference will produce knowledge that asserts definitively that your decision quality is high, whether it's a yes or no. Machine learning supports decisions, causal inference outputs decisions. To justify a causal inference assertion, the policy must prove to make better decisions than a person making decisions using the best available metrics from machine learning. That's more sophisticated than anything simple correlation can handle because the number of factors that contribute to decision quality is very high.
5/29/22, 10:33 PM - +234 813 324 1349: https://insights-dice-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/insights.dice.com/2022/05/26/will-the-great-resignation-drive-jobs-to-drop-college-requirements/?amp
5/29/22, 10:49 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Interesting. No 2 is rightly causal inference. But if you implement Bayesian inference in the way you described it in your example, it would not be causal inference and the results would be off. Working out the probability that an employee should get the subsidy makes it a predictive probabilistic model. It means you are looking at each employee and computing the posterior probability distribution of the outcome, conditioned on the joint distribution of the observations for that employee. That is a predictive approach.

Then, for question 1, check what I noted in my answer about the difference between the question versus when it is slightly rephrased. Question 1 is causal inference because it's a question of whether or not to make the decision. The response is a yes or a no that must be justified as the right decision. Machine learning doesn't justify decisions, it gives a certain likelihood that a decision quality will be high if the decision is taken based on some metric. Subtle differences 😁

5/29/22, 11:14 PM - +234 813 774 1580: Thanks for your input, but I disagree with you because conditional probability is different from causal calculus. The theory is the same but the mathematical application is different because causal calculus is based on actual occurrence of the event, e.g P(x | do{y}) - probability of x given that y is done or carried out successfully; is different from P(x | y) - probability of x given y(irrespective of the condition).
This I have applied on a real life project of recent.

For your follow up, read my sentence above. I said, 'if I'm to give you an answer because you want one' meaning I don't allow stakeholders to rush me. My approach is simple, think of fundamental ways the problem can be solved. Bucket those approach and isolate them then, analyse the available data, and combine the findings before suggesting the best way to the stakeholders. By so doing, you save yourself and the project including the stakeholder. Well I agree that they are both causal inference but try to understand the last part of the question.

5/30/22, 12:53 AM - +234 904 894 6475: @2348137741580, Again, interesting thoughts. Note that my goal in discussions like this is not to stimulate argument but to foster conversations that lead to better understanding of the nuances of subject matter.

I like your emphasis on causal calculus; it's a powerful tool that extends Bayes theory to model the effect of interventions. However, you cannot say conditional probability is different from causal calculus. This is because causal calculus is built on it. The application is also not different; in fact causal calculus applies conditional probabilities.

Secondly, the way you have described P(x | do{y}) makes it, in fact, the same as P(x | y) because the latter updates the degree of belief in x as information about the occurrence of y arises. For example, during inference in probabilistic modelling, we feed in data of actual occurrences to a trained Bayesian belief network or other suitable probabilistic graphical model, and the network returns the probability of the outcome based on those inputs that have actually already occurred.

What you missed is that the difference between P(x | do{y}) and P(x | y) lies in applying external intervention to hold y constant in P(x | do{y}). In P(x | y), the y event can change and each time changes occur, our degree of belief in x gets updated. In P(x | do{y}), we set an intervention to force y not to change and want to see the combined effects of this intervention and the observations on x.

With that being said, causal calculus cannot be applied for the questions in the way you have described it, given the way I specified the questions. Understand that the questions are not asking for inference based on relationship between observations and outcomes from historical data. They are asking for the relationship between a yes-or-no decision and the outcome of that decision. So in this case, it is not P(good performance after subsidising education | years spent & salary upper bound) more like what you earlier specified. It would actually be P(good decision | do{decision}).

On a last note, I agree with you that projects need not be rushed. A data scientist must carefully decompose the problem so well to understand what simple steps to take first before adding complexity if needed. However, I specified the 2 questions the way I did to present a data science use case that even many data scientists are not familiar with. My goal was specifically to stimulate reasoning about how to approach those problems from a decision science perspective. It doesn't mean they cannot be tackled in other, simpler ways. Also, machine learning can solve the 2 problems when you slightly rephrase them to shift from the decision maker to the data treatments the decision is to be made upon. 

For us that come from the mathematics field, it's a lot easy to catch these nuances because of years of reasoning grounded in rigour. Communicating it to a broad audience is a skill only a fraction of us have.

And the new company uses Stanbic. How do you go about it.

And please is it that company just decide what to remove from your salary as pension or there's a general percentage?
5/31/22, 6:52 AM - +234 907 429 6313: You can always switch ...just register with the PFA ur new company uses and give them ur pension pin.

5/31/22, 6:56 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Employers aren't supposed to choose your pension administrator for you.

They're supposed to take who you have and deposit for you.
5/31/22, 6:59 AM - +234 907 429 6313: Theoretically! Yes
But in reality most company have an SLA with some PFA to make pension operation easy, and they might insist you switch.
FYI! My firm as a PFA, they have suggested I switch but I haven't
5/31/22, 7:01 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Wasn't saying what was applicable.

I'm saying it's wrong for them to do that.

It's not acting in the best interest of the staff and everyone should be able to choose an administrator that provides the best return on their pension funds.
5/31/22, 7:02 AM - +234 812 527 3251: You honestly do not have to switch if you don't want to. The law says you provide a pension pin and that's all you are required to provide.

If for some reason your company doesn't process your pension then they could get in trouble. It's one small mail to PENCOM.

The SLA doesn't include you..

Thanks so much in advance🙇🏾‍♂️
5/31/22, 7:30 AM - +234 813 151 7157: In response to your second question, the stipulated percentage by law is 18% of your salary.
That 18% is broken into two parts:
1. 10% employer contribution; which is paid by your employer.
2. 8% employee contribution; which is paid by you, the employee from your salary/allowances.

Now, the bit of grey area relates to what portion of your salary or allowances that 18% is computed upon.

You may also decide to make additional deposits, called voluntary contributions to your pension account in addition to the 18% statutory contribution. The advantage is that it offers you access to some tax reliefs.
5/31/22, 7:44 AM - +234 812 527 3251: Lol not a Grey area if a breakdown of the components your salary (often provided) is known.

Employer - 10%*BHT
Employee - 8%*BHT

B - Basic Allowance 
H - Housing Allowance 
T - Transport Allowance

If you don't want to download a GUI SQL app.

5/31/22, 12:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Normally, after installing a database server on your system.

You need an application access the database and write your queries. For example SSMS for SQL Server, Toad for Oracle, DB Visualiser, pgAdmin for PostgreSQL

But an alternatively to these applications, you can use Command Prompt (CMD), command line interface (CLI) or PowerShell to access these database engines.

I sort of prefer VScode.

- Ease of pushing your codes/notebook directly to any repo 

- Ease of ssh to EC2 or any other cloud services to run your experiment in a jupyter environment and so on

Please have you ever come across this scenerio whereby you can see data for Person X on your report(powerbi) and then the user using same report can't see the data for the same Person X.
5/31/22, 5:04 PM - Anjola: If yes, how did you go about troubleshooting?
5/31/22, 5:04 PM - Anjola: Same

5/31/22, 5:05 PM - +234 906 092 6282: They most likely use Row Level Security or Object Level Security in the report
5/31/22, 5:07 PM - Anjola: The person can view the report but the mentioned Person X is not coming up in his report
5/31/22, 5:07 PM - +234 906 092 6282: It's a deliberate setting I suppose
5/31/22, 5:07 PM - Anjola: So let me explain how I did my troubleshoot for better understanding

N-B- This user also has been granted permission to the dataset and access to the report but he still can't view data for Person X.  However he is seeing data for other salesmen except for "Person X"

6/1/22, 2:33 AM - +234 810 258 9896: Locally?
6/1/22, 2:35 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Yeah, that's what I mean
6/1/22, 2:40 AM - +234 810 258 9896: The setup is straightforward
- you can set it up by downloading the binary file and add to PATH (any OS)
- you can pip install pyspark (python), however, I have not tried this before. I prefer the first approach.


For the 1st approach, if properly set, run spark/pyspark in the terminal should start up a spark session.
6/1/22, 2:42 AM - +234 810 258 9896: If you prefer step by step approach, run to youtube🫱🏾‍🫲🏾
6/1/22, 2:42 AM - +234 703 316 7142: I know all this

6/1/22, 3:03 AM - +234 708 145 1890: How did you resolve it?

6/1/22, 3:22 AM - +234 703 316 7142: So I'm setting up a Spark cluster in Standalone mode in our servers. Using one as master node and two other as worker node.

I already have spark & hadoop downloaded and all environment variables set. I then went to the conf folder in my spark folder on the Master Node to set it as master and set the worker nodes as worker in the worker file.

After all these is set, open a terminal in spark bin directory and run spark-class together another command to start-up the master node and log on to the worker nodes to do similar but mapping them to the master node to be registered.

6/1/22, 5:00 AM - +234 703 316 7142: If you buy Hard drive 2 TB, and put your things there, hard drive fit crash spoil or make e lost sef. So na you still lose abi you won do data redundancy for hardware too, make you buy like six drives make you distribute your files depending on your replication factor so if one lost you still dey alright.

6/1/22, 9:43 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Good read.

Thank you.
6/1/22, 9:47 AM - +234 706 439 6712: This is mad.....  I enjoyed reading. ..
6/1/22, 9:49 AM - +234 708 531 6273: He is able to pull it off because it is design. If na coding intensive job, he can't cope. 18 -19hrs a day translates to about 2-3 hours of productivity in my book 😅

But he has 250k to show for it. I am impressed.
6/1/22, 9:51 AM - +234 706 439 6712: 250k + came at a price and the consequence was obvious.
6/1/22, 9:51 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Can you post some specific errors
6/1/22, 9:52 AM - +234 905 555 4527: No module named ‘Wordcloud’
6/1/22, 9:53 AM - +234 708 531 6273: He will be fine.

Funnily enough, people are going thru similar thing in a single job without anything to show for it.

But all in all, we should control our greed. 3 jobs at once is too much. Haba!
6/1/22, 9:55 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Can you import it like this 

from wordcloud import WordCloud

6/1/22, 9:59 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Outright slavery. That's isn't productive, and nor does it give room for upskilling 



My my health is golden.......  If u want stress me, stress me with better pay... I fit endure for 3moths to 6months.

Or I just need to pick one X variable and one Y variable
6/1/22, 3:46 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Ur to regress Y on X₁, X₂ n X₃

U want to see the effects  X's have /has on the response variable (Y)/

So, plot Y on all the X's
6/1/22, 3:47 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Plot the regression curve, and see if the regression line is linear or the otherwise
6/1/22, 3:48 PM - +234 706 439 6712: From the curve, we would have an idea /insight on what to do next.. Help us we limit our ' guesses' for model selection
6/1/22, 3:49 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 💯
6/1/22, 3:51 PM - +234 803 895 5227: After that, also check for multicollinearity that will help in selecting which variables to consider
6/1/22, 3:51 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Somebody should come and patronize me😭
6/1/22, 3:51 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Outliers, too

6/1/22, 3:54 PM - +234 817 965 1769: Actually I have done this

What brought confusion is that

The R squared returned by regression analysis (from the data analysis pack) isn't the same with the one returned on the scatter plot after inserting the linear regression line

More Blessings 💯
6/1/22, 3:55 PM - +234 817 965 1769: Can outlier be the main reason you will consider nonlinear model?
6/1/22, 3:55 PM - +234 706 439 6712: How about the R* adjusted ?
6/1/22, 3:55 PM - +234 803 895 5227: Most times this happen when multicollinearity is involved

By building power apps, you can digitise the hardcopy form.

Through Power Automate, you can add approval legs.

And with the ever exciting Power BI, you can build a dashboard for real-time reporting

To start, check this out https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/power-plat-fundamentals/ this learning track will help you understand how these solutions work by creating one for yourself.

By the time you are done, you might be able to solve this business challenge

Please do you have any video tutorials on how to get the Dataverse trial version? 🤔 The documentation I saw is kinda overwhelming for me...
6/1/22, 6:27 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnn. . Can I ask what your usecase for using Dataverse is?
6/1/22, 6:27 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You sef no dey overwhelming?? You can assimilate the documentation in 24 hrs..
6/1/22, 6:35 PM - +234 806 593 5396: I came across it in the introduction to model-driven  apps and dataverse module of the *Build: Power Platform Apps Maker Challenge*. Having DataVerse up and running will be an extra motivation for me to proceed with the challenge.
6/1/22, 6:35 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Thank you so much

I will look into

You can play all you want with a developer account.
6/1/22, 6:39 PM - +234 816 296 3527: Try building a model-driven app. You'll get a prompt about starting a trial. Accept it and you're good.

PS: model driven apps use Dataverse as DB. And your knowledge of dynamics 365 will likely be a great advantage for you here.
6/1/22, 6:41 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Nah... This one no do am... I'm not sure it's one of the packages that came with the dev account.

Please any suggestions on how I can solve this. 

I'm trying to create a report in PowerBI and the data source is a shared network folder. I need to bring in about 100+ files from the folder but Power BI is taking hours to load the data.

Is there anything I can do to speed this up? 🙏🏾🙏🏾

6/3/22, 10:26 PM - +234 907 739 3129: Let me give my advice from speaking at tech conference. 

Submit Workshop as very few people will submit a Workshop. 

Workshop get easily accepted in every tech conference especially if it a topic trending with impact. 

Like Analytics Engineering, MLOps and related 

I'm not speaking because I'm among the organisers. 

Just a hint have observed to get your session accepted
6/3/22, 10:27 PM - +234 810 878 6913: When you say workshop, do you mean hands on?
6/3/22, 10:28 PM - +234 907 739 3129: Workshop is usually 45mins

6/4/22, 1:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Spot on
6/4/22, 1:42 PM - +234 818 047 2075: That's why I politely decline many mentorship requests I get on Linkedin. I typically point them to useful resources or groups.
6/4/22, 1:43 PM - +234 703 806 5681: People are obsessed with this "mentor" thing tbh.
6/4/22, 1:44 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I don't have a mentor. I do a number of people I run to for advice and whom I share updates with.

Then I have accountability partners for other different things.

6/5/22, 2:00 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Rt
6/5/22, 2:04 PM - +234 813 151 7157: A dice where three faces call 1B and 3 call 0 naira...
We have:
50% probability for 1B versus 100% probability for 1M
Defining what 1M Naira means  for one would also play a role.

If I'm advising, I'd say roll that dice...
6/5/22, 2:05 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Which die has two faces gan self?
6/5/22, 2:05 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Or how will they arrange the options?
6/5/22, 2:05 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I love this angle.
6/5/22, 2:06 PM - +234 904 894 6475: If I'm to correct what the original poster wrote, it should be a coin not a dice. A dice has 6 faces, a coin has 2.

So let's work with a coin; do we flip the coin or not?
6/5/22, 2:07 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Now, this is what I'm looking for. Approaching it with probability 😁
6/5/22, 2:10 PM - +234 818 213 4637: A coin I guess
6/5/22, 2:11 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes
6/5/22, 2:11 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Please who can help with the math. 

How many N1M do we have in N1billion? If I'm collecting N1m per month. How many months/years with it take me to eventually earn that N1billion?🤔

What are the chances of me rolling the dice and picking the N1billion - 50% abi? So I'll simply roll the dice and take my chance. I won't regret missing out on the N1m if it doesn't turn out in my favour. But you see that N1billion I may probably do something harmful to myself if I don't take the chance.
6/5/22, 2:11 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I go roll dice o, we only die once😂
6/5/22, 2:11 PM - +234 818 213 4637: There are so many factors tied to my decision.
6/5/22, 2:11 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 1000
6/5/22, 2:11 PM - +234 706 439 6712: As tempting as 1B looks. Having the mind the company has nothing to lose...


N100m is my take.


I would explain why .
6/5/22, 2:12 PM - +234 904 894 6475: There are 1000 1millions in 1 billion. Your response is killing me 🤣🤣🤣
6/5/22, 2:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: So you need 1000 1M to get N1B.
6/5/22, 2:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Where you see N100M??
6/5/22, 2:14 PM - +234 706 439 6712: N1M , rather
6/5/22, 2:14 PM - +234 904 894 6475: In other words, that chance needs to be offered to you 1000 times to get ₦1bn.

Whereas you could have actually got ₦1bn probably on the first or second try.
6/5/22, 2:14 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 🙌🏽🙌🏽
6/5/22, 2:15 PM - +234 703 316 7142: N1M wey no reach spend for club🌚
6/5/22, 2:17 PM - +234 703 316 7142: It will take 1000 people that collects N1M to get a single N1B. I'm willing to take the risk of those 1 thousand people than be among the masses🌚
6/5/22, 2:17 PM - +234 818 213 4637: The throw is happening just once. 

So it implies that I have 50% chance at 1 billion. Quite risky I suppose. 

But I can sell the risk. There are insurance companies that can buy a share in the bet. 

If I can sell the entire bet price in shares, I’m guaranteed at least 500M provided I get good deals.
6/5/22, 2:17 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Hmmm...so that's 1000 months to earn N1B. Even in 100 years I won't earn a billion if I'm collecting N1m per month.

But taking a second read, and saw that the poser really mentioned a dice with 2 options. So what happened to other faces of the dice 🎲 or what type of dice is this?🥲🙆🏾‍♂️
6/5/22, 2:18 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Oh wow, I didn't even think of this angle. Good one 👌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
6/5/22, 2:18 PM - +234 703 160 7868: 🥲🤣
6/5/22, 2:18 PM - +234 818 213 4637: 😂😂
6/5/22, 2:19 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I corrected what the original poster said; it should be a coin
6/5/22, 2:19 PM - +234 703 316 7142: This your response is looking as if this event is a preplanned one😂😂😂
6/5/22, 2:20 PM - +234 818 213 4637: I cannot take 1 million oo 😂
6/5/22, 2:20 PM - +234 904 894 6475: But I like it 😂
His response will be very appealing to executives. The company will definitely give it a go ahead.
6/5/22, 2:21 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Oh okay great. So we are really faced with the dilemma situation here ‐ Get rich or Die Trying.
6/5/22, 2:21 PM - +234 904 894 6475: We will strip you off your data title if you do 🤣

6/5/22, 2:23 PM - +234 818 213 4637: I saw the post too. A lot of people are saying “a bird at hand…” 

Omoo leave bird alone oo 😻😻
6/5/22, 2:23 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Toss the coin. All or nothing 😉

If you get 1bn you have more free cash flow to play with. 

If you get nothing, you're not worse off than you were before.
6/5/22, 2:23 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Frankly, I can take any of the two choices and justify that it is the right choice. 

A simple probability approach will justify option 1 is the right decision.

A utility theory approach will justify that option 2 is the right one.
6/5/22, 2:23 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's not a loss of 1m if you never had it in the first place.
6/5/22, 2:24 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Our risk boss has spoken 🙌🏽😂
6/5/22, 2:24 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Exactly
6/5/22, 2:24 PM - +234 818 213 4637: Exactly boss
6/5/22, 2:24 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly
6/5/22, 2:25 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You are not losing anything at the end, if you are offered N1B for a free risk. What the hell are you then thinking about😭😭
6/5/22, 2:25 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 😂
I was actually already thinking of what we did to even get to the point of needing money like this.

It'll mean I'm not doing my work well 😂😂😂
6/5/22, 2:25 PM - +234 703 160 7868: I like this! Mad money thinking.🔥🔥🔥
6/5/22, 2:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Isn't this in essence what start ups do with VCs though.
6/5/22, 2:26 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🤣
In this case, 2 birds in the bush are worth more than a bird at hand
6/5/22, 2:27 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 😂😂😂
6/5/22, 2:29 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You know, this isn't so different from the decisions you make while investing sha.

Dividend vs Growth stocks

You can get guaranteed passive income from your stocks in dividend companies. Low risk

Or invest with a potential growth company and get more capital appreciation that out performs the market. High risk (chances are your bet may be wrong)
6/5/22, 2:29 PM - +234 703 806 5681: So I like the input of @2348182134637 to transfer some of the risks involved.
6/5/22, 2:30 PM - +234 703 316 7142: It's better I take a risk for 50% probability than take a certainty worth 0.1% of highest possible ROI
6/5/22, 2:30 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Free investment!!!!
6/5/22, 2:32 PM - +234 904 894 6475: You have put it in another interesting way. This is a utility-based approach. Comparing the outcome (utility) of the 2 choices.
6/5/22, 2:32 PM - +234 818 213 4637: Interesting
6/5/22, 2:32 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Gbam... this is my reason too.
6/5/22, 2:34 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I'm actually surprised every response here as gone with the 2nd choice. I was expecting it to be like 50/50 🤣
6/5/22, 2:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know right 😂😂
6/5/22, 2:35 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They like money 🤧
6/5/22, 2:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: We are data people that think analytically really. Make inference you know because no certainty in data decisions
6/5/22, 2:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not really.
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's a joke jare
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Problems like this are interesting. Since money is involved, everyone takes it personal 😂
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 708 145 1890: The issue is 1M is not that valuable.
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know 🥶🥶
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 703 806 5681: What if it's $1m
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 817 840 3767: Sure! The guys here are also aware of investment instruments. So I expected it
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 703 806 5681: And poverty is destroying your life.

Will the decision change?
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Too much ifs
6/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 904 894 6475: What if it's in $$$ ? 🤔😂
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Beat me to it 😂
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 817 925 1327: @2348108522573 can I enter your dm?
It's related to YDP
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Too much Ifs 💀
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 708 145 1890: If it's in dollars I will reconsider 🫠
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Ifs are the variables na
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 😂😂
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Well said.
6/5/22, 2:37 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly. But I'm still waiting for a response going with option 1, with good justification
6/5/22, 2:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I think if we added certain   other justifications, we may have more 1s than 2s.

A certainty of money will become more important than the risk of losing it entirely.
6/5/22, 2:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: There are quite a number of variables to consider.

-The current value of the money
-Future value of the money
-My present economic situation
-Investment opportunities and options
6/5/22, 2:39 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Take this story to someone fresh out of school with a family dependent on them, and meagre 9-5 salary. 

You'll have a different answer.
6/5/22, 2:39 PM - +234 904 894 6475: More people will definitely go for option 1 if it were dollars.

The idea of $1bn is cognitive overload for most people. Easy to think of the prospect of winning $1m.
6/5/22, 2:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Totally yes.

If your family knows, they will pressure you self 😂
6/5/22, 2:39 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I think most of the people on the group who have answered so far, are reasonably comfortable
6/5/22, 2:40 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Easier*
6/5/22, 2:40 PM - +234 818 213 4637: If you tell them you want to toss the coin, they will think it’s “village people” 😹
6/5/22, 2:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Age bracket of the individual
6/5/22, 2:40 PM - +234 817 840 3767: True @2347038065681 , although it's still dependent on the person's risk appetite and information available to him/her
6/5/22, 2:41 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Lol...i guess both native and artificial intelligence will argue less with our decisions.😂
6/5/22, 2:41 PM - +234 817 840 3767: 🤭
6/5/22, 2:41 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly 😂
That's why I specified "company". A company wouldn't have all the typical personal problems.
6/5/22, 2:41 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Not entirely.

The burden of more mouth to feed will even make you think twice.
6/5/22, 2:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: True 😂😂
6/5/22, 2:42 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Well, companies have risk appetite too sha.

Let's consider that, as well as their corporate strategy.

If we are going to decide whether or not to take a risk (50-50), these are factors we must consider.
6/5/22, 2:43 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Kai... statistical thinking! 😁
6/5/22, 2:43 PM - +234 818 213 4637: Poverty is crazy! The decision would come without hesitation
6/5/22, 2:43 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂
6/5/22, 2:44 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly. If it were to be in $$$, you will find lots of companies leaning towards option 1. Low risk appetite, and option 1 has no risk.
6/5/22, 2:44 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Now if you were given the option to toss one more time, I'd definitely say pick option 2
6/5/22, 2:44 PM - +234 817 840 3767: 🤦🏽‍♂️
6/5/22, 2:45 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Since the question is directed to a Data Scientist which mean not relative to personal finance where Individual risk appetite varies based on varying factors. 

In the context of an organization, I think the odd of going with option 2 will be higher
6/5/22, 2:45 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Now, that $1m is already in the bag 😁
6/5/22, 2:46 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Why do you think so?
6/5/22, 2:46 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Then we would have had a serious problem subjecting this to both rational/irrational thinking.
6/5/22, 2:46 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Having worked both ends, I can say that business finance isn't so different from personal finance.

Take one and you can comfortably substitute the other.

Just my observations over time.
6/5/22, 2:47 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I guess I shouldn't have just streamlined it to data analysts/scientists, seeing that we have already gotten solid insights from other disciplines 😂
6/5/22, 2:47 PM - +234 703 806 5681: We can never separate behavioural bias from the issue of money.

Never 😁
6/5/22, 2:47 PM - +234 904 894 6475: If you are approaching it as a data scientist, you will have to suspend irrational thinking.
6/5/22, 2:48 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Because, in this case, you are not taking the decision for yourself
6/5/22, 2:48 PM - +234 703 806 5681: So you'll assume rationality?

Even when people are inherently irrational?

I'd like to see how behavioural science affects data analysis 🤔
6/5/22, 2:49 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Absolutely 💯
6/5/22, 2:49 PM - +234 904 894 6475: No I don't dispute the interplay between behavioural science and data science, especially in complex scenarios of decision making under uncertainty
6/5/22, 2:49 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Exactly.😌
6/5/22, 2:52 PM - +234 904 894 6475: In fact, decisions are leading indicators of behaviours
6/5/22, 2:53 PM - +234 703 316 7142: So let's put it this way, you are given this options:

1M if you get a head for tossing a coin
1B if you get a double when you roll two dice
6/5/22, 2:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Relative discrepancy of value.  

1M —> 1B alone  and knowing there is an odd with a probability of getting the higher return. 

DS itself build base on probability.
6/5/22, 2:56 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: There is Behavioral Data Science as a field of DS
6/5/22, 2:57 PM - +234 904 894 6475: For me, the goal is not to suspend irrationality entirely. But when I put on my DS tool belt I have to be precise enough to understand the limitations of my rationality and, if it's worth it, be disciplined enough to go with it despite my irrational objections.
6/5/22, 2:57 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Nice.
6/5/22, 2:57 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Okay. Fair enough.
6/5/22, 2:58 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Is this the same as Decision Sciences?

I just want to be clear
6/5/22, 2:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nah, it’s not.
6/5/22, 2:58 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes. This is where decision science interplays with data science.
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Already sounds interesting
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Let me look for an article I read one time about the emergency of the role.
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Not exactly the same, but there's an interplay
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: https://medium.com/behavior-design-hub/what-is-behavioral-data-science-and-how-to-get-into-it-e389ed20751f
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Thanks
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - +234 818 213 4637: The 1M is not even certain so why settle for it?

Mathematically,

The chance of getting the 1M is 0.5 while that of getting 1B is 0.17
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes yes.
6/5/22, 2:59 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
6/5/22, 3:00 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
6/5/22, 3:00 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Another angle.
6/5/22, 3:00 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Ah, nobody will opt for the first choice o 🤣
6/5/22, 3:01 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Asin 😂😂😂
6/5/22, 3:03 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You think so??

The person has 50% chance compared to 16.6%🤔
6/5/22, 3:04 PM - +234 809 183 1446: As someone who has a net worth < 1M 🌚

I'd for for the 1M..

There's a 50% of getting 1M compared to ~17% of getting 1B.

Let's go local a bit.. when playing Ludo or monopoly, how often does one roll a double number? 😅
6/5/22, 3:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I company won’t have net worth <1M 😂😂😂
6/5/22, 3:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *a
6/5/22, 3:06 PM - +234 703 806 5681: A small company would, when it's a start up.
6/5/22, 3:07 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Annually or Biannually or Monthly😂
6/5/22, 3:08 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The problems I posted the other day about causal inference are also behavioural problems. Where a company has to decide whether or not to subsidise college education for its employees.

Here knowledge from data science, behavioural science and decision science are needed to fully specify the complex relationship between the decision and the outcome.

Because as it turns out, there's a complex behavioural dynamics that influences performance on the job. A company has to know whether having educated employees will optimise this behavioural dynamics and ultimately improve job performance. If job performance improves, the decision is high quality. Else, the decision is low quality. With causal inference, we can test several combinations of behavioural dynamics until we fully understand what exact combination is required to maximise the desired outcome. With that full policy, we can then infer whether or not the decision is high quality.
6/5/22, 3:09 PM - +234 809 183 1446: I was referring to an individual who doesn't make much.
6/5/22, 3:09 PM - +234 904 894 6475: But now let's map those percentages to their monetary value. Do you still want to go with option 1? 🤣
6/5/22, 3:09 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

Do you write on Medium or a blog?
6/5/22, 3:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Safe to say this is a justifiable reason that DS is haaard
6/5/22, 3:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And it’s too ambiguous 💀

I hail all the Data Scientist here. You guys are the real MVP 😂
6/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I have not been writing blogs for about 2 years 🥲

Trying to get back to it
6/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 818 721 1515: Basically, the greatest hurdle to clear is the financial position of the one in question...
6/5/22, 3:11 PM - +234 903 783 8682: <Media omitted>
6/5/22, 3:12 PM - +234 904 894 6475: One major setback then was that my medium account was suspended for a reason I don't know till date. I just didn't bother opening another one. So I just write on LinkedIn every now and then.
6/5/22, 3:12 PM - +234 818 721 1515: If the company is a startup facing financial constraint and is on a red, with notice to fold, having 1 million keeps it afloat...


The company has mouths to feed, and workers to pay, it can't afford to think big on the die of 1 billion...
6/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Whoever put reinforcement learning in this list literally placed a galaxy in a solar system 😅
6/5/22, 3:13 PM - +234 703 806 5681: So start a blog of your own.

WordPress
Substack (or whatever it's called)

But better to own than rent space on the web.
6/5/22, 3:14 PM - +234 903 783 8682: 🤔

Reinforcement learning is one of three broad categories of Machine Learning.
6/5/22, 3:15 PM - +234 818 721 1515: Then, the next constraint is the die itself, because mathematically I want to work with it being a die...

With 2 options, there are different ways the die can be formed...
One is what @2348131517157 pointed out as 3 faces for 1B and 3 for zero... But then, 1 face for 1B and 5 faces for zero is totally possible as well...

No one said anything about the die being unbiased...
6/5/22, 3:15 PM - +234 818 721 1515: That's literally "terms and conditions apply"...💀💀💀
6/5/22, 3:16 PM - +234 903 783 8682: True.

Even a free blogspot with a 5k per year .com domain name is better than medium.
6/5/22, 3:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/5/22, 3:16 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Except that Google can wake up and decide to discontinue blogspot, like they did Google Plus
6/5/22, 3:16 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Interesting, another way we can force the die to produce only 2 options is if we specify a specific outcome as success and all other 5 outcomes as failure.
6/5/22, 3:17 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Own the space. 

WordPress.org

Buy domain on namecheap or whatever
6/5/22, 3:17 PM - +234 903 783 8682: WordPress advocates have been saying this thing since. Yet blogger is still there gidigba
6/5/22, 3:17 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Substack is gaining popularity these days, especially for tech blogs
6/5/22, 3:18 PM - +234 903 783 8682: That said, I strongly support having a self hosted WordPress site as others are saying.
6/5/22, 3:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Substack is what folks are using now sha
6/5/22, 3:18 PM - +234 903 783 8682: What is substack again?
6/5/22, 3:18 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Doesn't matter what folks are using dear.

If they close your account, e don go
6/5/22, 3:18 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Another platform
6/5/22, 3:18 PM - +234 806 593 5396: @2349048946475 pls just change your name to Power BI 😂

Make my brain rest biko
6/5/22, 3:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They won’t 🥱
6/5/22, 3:19 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I'm sure Zion thought the same with Medium 🤧
6/5/22, 3:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Better to use something that’s easy to explore 💀
6/5/22, 3:19 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's the same argument for Cex and Dex
6/5/22, 3:19 PM - +234 903 783 8682: This message was deleted

You literally define the menu ni.
6/5/22, 3:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Odd of that happening is low 😂.  And if it does life happen 

We move.
6/5/22, 3:20 PM - +234 904 894 6475: True o 🤣
6/5/22, 3:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I'm all for easy o

Already typed Substack before I decided he might as well get his own space.

But whatever makes everyone happy ni.
6/5/22, 3:22 PM - +234 903 783 8682: With 15k yearly you can become your own landlord on the internet.

You'll have a .com domain and professional email.
6/5/22, 3:22 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's like saying use LinkedIn for newsletter. When you can just get convert kit or mailchimp and own it.

Easy is nice. But it limits your control and costs more sometimes.
6/5/22, 3:22 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Self hosted WordPress is still the best option.

It has a bit of a learning curve but nothing special there.
6/5/22, 3:23 PM - +234 903 783 8682: +1
6/5/22, 3:23 PM - +234 816 424 7582: Can you imagine!!!!

6/5/22, 3:26 PM - +234 903 783 8682: And you can monetize your self hosted blog as you wish.

Instead of medium telling you "This service is not available in your region"

6/5/22, 3:50 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Let me answer this now. As I said earlier, I can pick the first option and justify it using simple probability. I can use utility theory to justify the second option.
6/5/22, 3:54 PM - +234 904 894 6475: *1) Simple probability:* 
We take the choice that maximises probability

For option 1, probability of win = 100%

For option 2:
P(win) = 50%
P(lose) = 50%

Option 1 maximises probability so we opt for it. Now this approach doesn't take into account the value of our choices. It only quantities the uncertainty of the choice.

So this is the ideal quantitative approach for anyone who puts more priority on uncertainty than expected value.
6/5/22, 4:09 PM - +234 904 894 6475: *2) Utility-based approach:*

Here, we work out the expected utility (or value) of each decision.

The expected utility (or expectation) of a choice is simply the outcome times the probability of that outcome.

For option 1, probability is 1:
E(option 1) = ₦1m × 1 = ₦1m

For option 2, we have to work out the expectation of each outcome and take the sum. Probability of win and of loss are both 0.5

E(win) = ₦1b × 0.5 = ₦500 million
E(loss) = 0 × 0.5 = 0

Adding it up,
E(option 2) = E(win) + E(loss) 
= ₦500 million + 0
= ₦500 million

 *Summary:*
Expected utility of option 1 is ₦1 million, expected utility of option 2 is ₦500 million. By taking the decision that maximises expected utility, I will advise the company to take option 2.

6/5/22, 4:28 PM - +234 706 439 6712: We can check it out...
6/5/22, 4:35 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The goal of an analytical approach like this is not to definitively make money in every single scenario, but to quantify what decision is best to take and how much risk that decision exposes you to. 

For example, you opt for the second option not because you know for sure you will get ₦1bn in one trial, but because you know the probability of getting it and you know the expected utility. 

The goal is not to make money every time, but to take the risks that will bring about the highest cumulative gains when such offers come over and over again.

It will take this trial being repeated 1000 times to get to ₦1bn if we always choose option 1. But for option 2, even if we get ₦1bn twice in 1000 trials (which is almost impossible), you already have twice as much.
6/5/22, 4:46 PM - +234 703 160 7868: It's the concluding paragraph for me.👌🏽 Almost summarizes the whole discussion we have had while it effectively rationalizes any decision that may be taken if presented with varying circumstances.

6/6/22, 9:38 AM - +234 809 081 1000: This is showing the performance of the gross earning and earning after tax deductions per Bank
6/6/22, 9:38 AM - +234 809 081 1000: Shows Zenith Bank is leading the pack and FBN among the samples is the least.
6/6/22, 9:39 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Anyone here please reach out to chiedozie
6/6/22, 9:41 AM - +234 809 081 1000: Gross earning is the Total Income earned by these FI over the period I  review not including taxes...This also shows the exposure of the Earnings to Tax and how much the government coughers have received from the bucket.
6/6/22, 9:48 AM - +234 818 047 2075: This looks nice. But the figures are confusing. Wondering why Zenith is number 1  and GT is number 3.
6/6/22, 9:49 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Because it's based on the Profits.
6/6/22, 9:50 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Gross earnings (probably inclusive of taxes) is not the actual profit.

The bar chart is arranged in terms of increasing profits. Profits without taxes which is the actual gain.
6/6/22, 9:52 AM - +234 818 047 2075: I know and thats why it is confusing. People will typically look at the lower bar first (gross earnings). They should have put in a title, may be something that says Zenith is the most profitable.
6/6/22, 9:58 AM - +234 818 047 2075: There's no reason why gross earnings of Zenith and Access should look the same.
6/6/22, 9:58 AM - +234 703 806 5681: You get?
6/6/22, 9:59 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... I get your point clearly.
6/6/22, 9:59 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Now it look like the graph was painted not plotted 😅
6/6/22, 10:01 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Exactly, it looks nice but doesn't communicate the message

6/6/22, 11:16 AM - +234 703 786 9165: I think there's some tax evasion politics at play here cos how is Access Bank having more gross earning but paying more tax?
6/6/22, 11:16 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I guess nope, you can store different object types on OneDrive asides the regular tabular files

6/6/22, 11:20 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Naturally, files stored on OneDrive can only be accessed by people who are granted access to them
6/6/22, 11:21 AM - +234 810 831 6393: There however are different level of access sha
6/6/22, 11:21 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Levels*
6/6/22, 11:34 AM - +234 806 926 8443: Good News...

6/6/22, 1:35 PM - +234 818 484 5784: The story from the Viz is wrong probably from the type of Chart 📉 used for it.
 Access Bank and Zenith Bank have the gross earnings from the column heights but from the data labels it's quite opposite as Access Bank has a higher Gross earning than Zenith. 
A Clustered column Chart should be a better option for this Visual
6/6/22, 1:52 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 👌cluster chart would have been better
6/6/22, 1:59 PM - +234 904 894 6475: On data products and experimentation

6/6/22, 2:17 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Clustered Column Chart will struggle cos of the difference between the Gross Earning and PAT. This is more of an infographic design and the brilliant use of color helps readability for me. At a more closer look, it obvious that the sort was based on PAT in ascending order and Zenith Bank had more PAT than other banks despite the fact that it is the second highest in terms of Gross earning. GTCO had the least Gross Earning but more PAT than FBN Holdings and UBA.
6/6/22, 2:43 PM - +234 812 216 8133: The visual shows the PAT in increasing order, but the Gross earnings follows no pattern. What do you want to understand from the visaul?
6/6/22, 2:43 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Tosin the viz genius 🙌

Thank God say my boss Sabi the data well, one sight and he knew something was wrong.

😩
6/6/22, 7:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s crazy mehn

Mine is even a partial dedup with snapshot and not the full dedups.
6/6/22, 7:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Trying to handle SCD type 2  and I didn’t make provision for partial dedup. 

Been on this for like 3hrs trying to understand why the numbers weren’t jiving
6/6/22, 7:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data failures  really disastrous because everything will be working fine without you knowing you have cook better beans
6/6/22, 7:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This remind me of my CEO at Cw. My oga too sabi. 

Throw any number at him his gut will let me know something is wrong 😂.  I can’t forget throwing one number baba smile “Ope please check that number again before we go and start smiling to investor 😂”. 

I checked and discover dups demon has creeped in

6/6/22, 7:33 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Hi @2348103210794 

We would hold you accountable in 3 months for this skill 🤗
6/6/22, 7:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: If not because I had built credibility I for cast that day 😂😂😂. 

After that day before I throw any number out I will double different checks and validation then start praying God abeg I don’t want to lose my cred
6/6/22, 7:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: A company sacked all their Data team cos of lack of credibility  due to error from wrong numbers 😥

Losing credibility as a Data professional is a worst nightmare
6/6/22, 7:43 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Oh... Wow
6/6/22, 7:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not at all

US
6/6/22, 7:44 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yesss! You get it boss.

Everything will look seemingly fine.
6/6/22, 7:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Come to think of this. 

I’m curious to hear people’s thought what could have been done??
6/6/22, 7:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I mean to avoid that. 

A little data error overtime became a nightmare
6/6/22, 7:48 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Reading this again, and I'm reminded of Eric Weber's words that quality data creates trust with leadership.
6/6/22, 7:51 PM - +234 818 047 2075: How do you avoid this. I just finished battling one today. Told a team member to rewrite SQL script by using CTE instead of temp tables. He shared the code last week and it worked fine. But I then just decided to compare the data and noticed 2 column values were different by about 30%. Just this 2 of over 40 columns were off.
6/6/22, 7:52 PM - +234 818 047 2075: So I started thinking how could this have been prevented especially because the column can have a wide range since it varies based on customer behavior.
6/6/22, 7:52 PM - +234 818 047 2075: *columns
6/6/22, 7:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I'm curious to know whether the devastating business impact was happening periodically with each incremental error or was a cumulative sweep from all errors combined.
6/6/22, 7:53 PM - +234 818 047 2075: The issue was he was meant to put a date filter since it is an end of month computation but that was missing
6/6/22, 7:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No truer words. 

Had a meeting with a stakeholder last week and the CMO asked “Can this model be trusted ?”  I keep mute for some seconds before I uttering a word “I believe so 😂”. After that call I went to go and check again if I mistakenly modeled the wrong thing.
6/6/22, 7:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💀💀💀💀
6/6/22, 7:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s a cumulative. It looks like a metric that isn’t tracked regularly more like a North Star metrics that is used for a time based decision.
6/6/22, 7:56 PM - +234 818 047 2075: How do you avoid these ki d of data source or transformation data issues. Some can be so salient and easily go unnoticed
6/6/22, 7:56 PM - +234 818 047 2075: ?
6/6/22, 8:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: A source data metric dashboard may help that monitors source freshness and the health of the source data itself so as to help give  an idea if there is consistency between what is in the DW/source system. I think this could help because data latency  and late data arriving could be a potential cause. 

And for intermediate layer where there is correctness in source data, a custom logic can be built into the transformation more like a unit testing the models. dbt makes this achievable in combo with Great expectations 

I’m curious to hear @2348164847452 @2347085316273 thoughts
6/6/22, 8:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2348106129023 seems to work a lot on Data quality wahala 😂 maybe he can have a say
6/6/22, 8:08 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Omo! Source and destination monitoring oh!
6/6/22, 8:09 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Throw in alerting too
6/6/22, 8:23 PM - +234 810 258 9896: The source and the designation of data do not belong to the same organization. What if the wrong data were pulled?

Remember from the message, the provider could tell why it is happening, there is an integrity problem from their end.

However, if the destination has a particular metric they expect, it would have been the closest way to handle the problem.

It is fascinating the could detect.
6/6/22, 8:23 PM - +234 810 258 9896: The provider couldn't* tell ....
6/6/22, 8:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na e choke level of wahala
6/6/22, 8:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂
6/6/22, 8:25 PM - +234 816 484 7452: So apparently, It is going to be a long read from what I would type. I wish I could send a VN.

But thinking about it, one or two rows out of 40M row is affecting metric??

How??
6/6/22, 8:26 PM - +234 810 258 9896: 😂😂😂😂
6/6/22, 8:26 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣🤣🤣

6/6/22, 8:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data issue na your mate 🥱
6/6/22, 8:29 PM - +234 806 593 5396: No send VN abeg...your voice is too sweet 😍
6/6/22, 8:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💀💀💀
6/6/22, 8:44 PM - +234 816 484 7452: We need to understand that it is difficult to present something technical casually to business guys wey no sabi jack. So I would suggest this line of approach below.

Firstly ehn, this is not happening for the first time and since according to them, these 2 or 3 rows affects figures greatly. I would want to say it is some kind of accounting scenario as trust me if the top Stakeholders gets displeased easily with this (which seems more like a toxic workplace to me already)  then, they should have done the following.

0. Understand why the business is so irritated and angered by this. 

1. On the second occurrence, they should have escalated seriously in such a way that they would let the Business Top Guns know the consequences of having to handle this from the internal team's end and raised SLA concerns because this is third party data. SLA and compliance are very important when dealing with third party data. It is good as Engrs to know what level of accuracy to expect when dealing with external systems so as to put this into design consideration. Read the docs and understand the SLAs of this external tools and systems first.

2. Dedicate time to investigate and perform analysis to prove it is really that a few missing records that causes a discrepancy. They are non-technical people and they won't try to understand the issue unless you *STORY-TELL IT*. Also come up with recommendation and highlight you really need the vendor's assistance.

3. And Since the third Party Guys kept giving the same response, they should have revisited their current Data Env Design and let let the business know the extra cost to put checks on validating extra data because this would mean special implementations on logs and monitoring of Source data.(Though this would give room for even some redundant implementations just to make sure data is valid)

3. Propose new solution and cost analysis to the business on what accommodating this discrepancy from the internal team end would look like.

4. Get the Business Final decision and shoot
6/6/22, 8:45 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But Business Stakeholder wanting to fire entire team is a Red Flag for me.

It probably means they haven't been getting adequate value from their data.
6/6/22, 8:47 PM - +234 816 484 7452: *If they don't clear the business rift between Engrs and the business, then they won't even be able to clear the major technical bug in their data*
6/6/22, 8:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I bet to disagree with your 2nd paragraph o about the disposition of stakeholders been toxic 😂

I believe working with sensitive financial and regulatory data, an accuracy of  100% will be what they are looking for. So I don’t think that’s toxic sha😂
6/6/22, 8:48 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Because Engrs handling a Million Dollar Project are definitely capable of building technical solutions to solve such bug
6/6/22, 8:49 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The reason I said so is because, it is as if there is *NO FORM OF EMPATHY* on the Engrs

Is it easy to build scalable systems like that. 
Engr is iteration upon iteration to get the best system
6/6/22, 8:52 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yeah even with 100% accuracy expectations, Third Party or External guys are already involved. Na why I talk sey SLA dey important here.

The Engrs would just need to communicate this to their Business guys properly by story telling it as I said. Though it is still a toxic environment sha.

*Stakeholders are MAD* it is the word *MAD* for me.

No be netflix intern send test emails mistakenly to the whole world the other day
6/6/22, 8:52 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Or go the legal way by looking out for loopholes in the 3rd party vendor where they promised 💯 data sync and sue them 😂😂
6/6/22, 8:53 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Here this is also part of the investigation
6/6/22, 8:54 PM - +234 816 484 7452: If na me be the Lead Engr, 
I go sue the third Party Company
I go sue our Top Business Stakeholders for wrong usage of words and communication of bad emotions on a hard working team

Because a Data team working on a Million Dollar Project go get plenty star boys and girls oo
6/6/22, 8:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah definitely the SLA is very key. 

I feel for those data guys sha.
6/6/22, 8:55 PM - +234 816 484 7452: There should definitely be something in Law or Labour that can protect the Engrs
6/6/22, 8:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Protect in what sense? 😂
6/6/22, 8:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know there are laws protecting the engineeering professional ( I can remember Engineering Law course that year), but I don’t know if it applies to Data/Software Engineers 😂
6/6/22, 9:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Normally when designing systems, there would have been provision for this. The best thing to do is to attack it vigorously when it occurs once so that it never happens again.

At the beginning, you literally can't over design as part of the goal of a DE is Cost Optimization in terms of Infrastructure.
So it is an iteration you would keep improving on.

*Just make sure to attack it with all you have got when it happens once*

Even the big techs suffer data bugs like this once in a while. 
PowerBI dashboard connected to Terabytes of data for that matter sef dey get bug for big tech how much more others.
6/6/22, 9:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It does actually. Some countries have things in place.

Why do you think in the UK, you can't sack any Engr anyhow
Instead the companies go dey ball you and they would be extra careful and patient with you.
6/6/22, 9:02 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But in our part of the world, you go just wake up see sey you no fit log in again😂🤣

But them don close eye
6/6/22, 9:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Your 2nd point very key. One data thought leader said “Educate your stakeholders when starting out that they can only trust the data 80-90% to help manage expectation”.  Though I had some reservations I don’t know 😂 what if it’s a business that need close to 100%. 

Do you think posing such would have help the above stakeholders before it got to the stage of threaten to sack the team if they are well informed the Data can only be to a degree of accuracy and certainty. 

Curious to hear @2348180472075 @2349048946475 as head of Data who make decisions.

6/6/22, 9:21 PM - Abraham Musa: Ope asked me a question that stirred up a thought in my mind.

It seems like most senior tech professionals end up with non tech girlfriends/wives. 🤔🤔🤔

I wonder what could be the correlation and causation... Checked my circle and immediately discovered that over 80% of senior tech people I know follow this pattern - very interesting hypothesis.

@2348164847452 , @2348108522573 , @2348180472075 , @2348108316393 , @2347060577846, @2348117927254 and other senior guys here. Want to hear from all of una. 😀

By default any tech lady you meet already has a rough estimate of how much you earn 🤣🤣

Finding love is a journey and lots of comprises do take place when you finally found the perfect match.

At this point, the weight attributed to the spouse profession might be highly negligible.


Recently, I have seen Tech Bros and Sis hooking up to each other. This seems natural to me as the Tech circle grows bigger, the likelihood of finding a mate increases 😊. For example, some bros are eyeing some of our YDP ladies 😂. You see... Simply because there is a growing community. Things were not really like this 5 years ago.

A great read 👍 

With the advent of ELT MDS paradigm comes chaos. 

More chaos means more opportunities in the Data space. The best time to start data really is now as more opportunities will continue to evolve for skilled and talented folks 🥱

6/6/22, 10:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂

@2348163815935 your sample size too small 😂. This may be an insights from Gen Z and maybe lower band of Millenians.  

Quickly do an A/B test to assert that statement.

6/6/22, 11:25 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I'm still wondering how a few rows off will lead to the proclaimed disaster. At 10 million rows, you still have a solid 99.99998% at the very least.

But I feel there are lots of behind-the-scenes we are not seeing here, considering that the project is being executed for a client. Perhaps the issue is not that the missing data has a direct negative impact on the project. It could be that the SLA with the client has a clause that specifies a 100% data integrity requirement, a breach of which would incur a certain cost to the business.

It becomes a problem when the engineers are not aware of this clause or don't even have access to the SLA. It's easier to build precautions aforehand when you already know the impact of the slightest failures.
6/6/22, 11:26 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Well said boss 😂

He’s one of my weekly read
6/6/22, 11:57 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Interestingly core old engineers don’t buy the MDS idea even though they know it’s a concept that can’t be avoided. 

Maxim (Author of Airflow and fondly referred to as Father of Modern Data Engineering) presented a case on the evolution of MDS and AE can be maximized.

6/7/22, 8:03 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Tbh I never saw chaos in a space as a good thing until I heard Martin Casado of a16z talk about this at Coalesce. According to him, chaos means things are constantly evolving. When things are evolving, the space keeps growing. As the space grows, opportunities keep opening up.
6/7/22, 8:11 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes. 

I was shocked to hear that too during his presentation 😂😂

Working with the MDS truly will be chaotic as more tools unfold creating an overhead and bottlenecks as it relate to managing. 

The number of vendors I have tested their products that integrate with MDS in the last 6 months really proves there will be lot of chaos and difficulty to decide the tool stack to setup and how to properly manage which will increase billing. 

It’s really interesting to behold the space evolve and catch up with it

6/8/22, 6:20 AM - +234 703 845 5619: Good morning everyone,

Omo I get a data model challenge I have been racking my head about..

The goal is to create a MRR model and churn model. 

1. It's a subscription business

2. A subscription by a customer lasts for 4 months. For example, if I subscribe with 10k in January 2023, it will expire in April 2023. And if I don't subscribe again in May 2023, then I would have been considered churned.

3. Number 2 above implies that a customer can have only max 3 subscriptions per year. 

Problem:

1. I want to create a MRR model that captures first month and last month of subscription.

2. That prorates the payment made in the first month through out the 4 months so that a $10 subscription made on January 2022 would have MRR of $2.5 between January and March 2022. 

3. Capture first and last active month and consider months without any activity as churned. 


I have worked on some things using dbt MMR model as a guide, but kole-work...

My Ogas @2348108522573 @2347033167142 .et all please what are your thoughts on how I should approach this?

Thank you

6/8/22, 10:05 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2347038455619 

Bullet 3 in problem section seem to contradict bullet 2. If a subscription last for 4 months that means if a customer is active plan started this month that mean the plan will run for June/July/August/September. Is there a possible understanding why such customer will still be classified as churn for those month in-between ?
6/8/22, 10:06 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Or if I get you correctly you want to capture active subscription month for each customer which last for 4 month or is it possible for a customer to stop a subscription after a month or 2 and not complete the cycle??
6/8/22, 10:07 AM - +234 904 894 6475: <Media omitted>
6/8/22, 10:07 AM - +234 802 109 5948: It depends😑
6/8/22, 10:08 AM - +234 703 845 5619: Boss you are correct here...

The customer would be churned only if he does not renew in October and not in the months in between.
6/8/22, 10:08 AM - +234 706 439 6712: My experience in ph was amazing, fun, and crazy...
6/8/22, 10:09 AM - +234 706 439 6712: I actually served in ph,  some years bk....... I love it there..... They're  full of life..... But if u do anyhow.. U go collect , asap.  There's violence in dia blood..  Small tin, den don ginger 😁
6/8/22, 10:09 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So there is no edge case of a customer churning without completing the subscription cycle right?
6/8/22, 10:09 AM - +234 703 845 5619: every subscriber must complete the cycle as one payment covers for the 4 month cycle. 

Active months would be the months included in the cycle
6/8/22, 10:10 AM - +234 703 845 5619: yes sir. 

churning only starts if the customer does not renew after the 4 month cycle.
6/8/22, 10:11 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Gotya.
6/8/22, 10:11 AM - +234 703 845 5619: I want to also prorate the payment made in the first month through out the remaining months in the cycle.

Thank you boss
6/8/22, 10:12 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Is this payment a constant subscription fee or varies per product subscribed to?
6/8/22, 10:12 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Is this data coming from another source system or same?
6/8/22, 10:13 AM - +234 703 845 5619: The fee varies per product subscribed to.
6/8/22, 10:14 AM - +234 703 845 5619: All data is coming from the same source system.
6/8/22, 10:15 AM - +234 806 593 5396: @2348108522573 check your DM 🌚 Emi lokan 😂
6/8/22, 10:15 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Last question what metric do you want to track?

Monthly MRR or aggregated MRR as at date?
6/8/22, 10:16 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Ooh 😃😃

Apologies, I will check.
6/8/22, 10:17 AM - +234 904 894 6475: See as Opeyemi dey ask all the right questions like senior consultant 🙌🏽😁

6/8/22, 10:23 AM - +234 703 845 5619: 🙌🙇🏽‍♂️
6/8/22, 10:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: One more question I don’t want to assume. 

How does your source system capture subscription date? Does it only reflect the start/end date for for each subscription/users? Like what’s the granularity of the subscription data from source?
6/8/22, 10:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *subscription data 

~subscription date~
6/8/22, 10:26 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Maybe as follow-up to check my understanding. 

If I am customer I subscribed in January and next time I sub again is November, does the subscription system capture May-September or it just capture my next start date after the last subscription ended
6/8/22, 10:26 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: ?
6/8/22, 10:28 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *May-Oct. rather.
6/8/22, 10:36 AM - +234 703 845 5619: Okay this is the interesting part😄

If 1 subscribe this month, the source system only captures the date of payment i.e January and ignores the other months in the cycle. 

and if another payment is made after the cycle, the system only captures the date of payment. 

In other words, the source system does not capture the cycle. 

Another case in the source system is how it handles Annual payments. 

If I pay in January for a whole year, this equals 3 cycles of Jan to April, May to August, Sept to Dec and the source system only captures the dates JAN, MAY and SEPT with the same subscription_id for the period; i.e 3 records with the same subscription_id and dates that only match the start of the subscription. 

I however created surrogate key for subscription_id as I believe that each subscription whether annual or one time payments should be unique. 

2. Based on your analogy, if you subscribe in January only one record is created for your with date in January. If your next sub is in Nov, the system only captures one record for that with date in Nov. 


Please ask more for further clarification boss
6/8/22, 10:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Great, it’s the expected. 

That means there is a subscription type field that indicate whether it’s annual the user subscribed to or quarterly right?
6/8/22, 10:40 AM - +234 703 845 5619: yes sir.
6/8/22, 10:57 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You may not necessarily need uniqueness per se since the subscription_id only identify unique subscription. 

I’m thinking through an approach leveraging on your shared info
6/8/22, 10:58 AM - +234 703 845 5619: okay okay,
6/8/22, 11:02 AM - +234 703 845 5619: so an annual payment would be a unique id that applies on all 12 months of the year?
6/8/22, 11:06 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Spot on. Since the id is tied uniquely to just 1 customer. You will factor annual subscription into your modeling. 

Annual/quarterly doesn’t really matter per se in this instance since your goal is to capture activeness and inactivity, so you already know if a customer has an annual subscription that mean the  customer will be active next 12 Month ahead. 

However, your modeling approach may now change if you want your downstream user to have a filter that indicate subscription type in case they are interested in knowing with subscription type have the impact on MRR. This is also possible but will create little complication in modeling. Since they haven’t asked you just assume they don’t need it yet 😂😂 when they do you will update the existing model you built without considering that.
6/8/22, 11:09 AM - +234 703 845 5619: hmmm😅😅... Okay boss.. Thank you sir.
6/8/22, 11:10 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na the way.
6/8/22, 11:12 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Another question 

Can you create a sample of how your current data looks like?

subscription_id | customer_id | payment_date | subscription_type | amount 


Is this it?
6/8/22, 11:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Another question pop up 

Is it possible for a customer have multiple active subscription at a time?

Confirm this and don’t assume o before DUPES frustrate you and you are wondering where is the error coming from (learn from my mistake 😂). 

Let that be part of your test.
6/8/22, 11:28 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Honestly I wish we had slack or discord for YDP. Someone else with a similar problem will have been able to track this solution easily 🥲. But from experience, people prefer whatsapp and not Slack and Discord in this part of the world.🤔
6/8/22, 11:29 AM - +234 818 415 3106: There's a slack channel
6/8/22, 11:29 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Honestly 

Things more organized with slack and others. But my people here don’t like slack😂😂
6/8/22, 11:29 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do you use it 😥
6/8/22, 11:30 AM - +234 818 415 3106: <Media omitted>
6/8/22, 11:30 AM - +234 703 845 5619: subscription_id | customer_id | payment_date | subscription_type | amount | appointment_date | request_state | product_type


where payment date is the creation date. 
appointment_date is the schedule date when the job will be done. 
subscription_type = whether annaul or quarter
product_type = subscription product type
request_state = location of the request.
6/8/22, 11:31 AM - +234 703 845 5619: yes, a customer can have multiple subscriptions at the same time
6/8/22, 11:32 AM - +234 703 845 5619: <Media omitted>
6/8/22, 11:32 AM - +234 703 845 5619: I just did this now.. last 6 columns shows a customer can have multiple subs running at the same time
6/8/22, 11:35 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nice. 

Your first task is to remodel this date to look like this ;

subscription_id | customer_id | start_date which is the payment _date | end date which will be dependent on the subscription type | amount 

E.g 

If subscription type is annual and payment_date (start date) is 2022-06-08 then end date = 2023-06-08

Use that logic to calculate end date for each customer and subscription
6/8/22, 11:35 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do you get?
6/8/22, 11:36 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Heads-up :

Model such as this will be computationally heavy as such create a senate job for it so it doesn’t increase run time for your other jobs.
6/8/22, 11:36 AM - +234 703 845 5619: OKay boss. Yes I get.
6/8/22, 11:38 AM - +234 703 845 5619: hmmm
6/8/22, 11:38 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *separate
6/8/22, 11:39 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Hmm
6/8/22, 11:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Can you explain?

A customer can have 2 annual or 1 annual/1 quarterly?
6/8/22, 11:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Or subscription based on product?
6/8/22, 11:42 AM - +234 703 845 5619: A customer can have 3 vehicles and have 3 different annual subscriptions on those vehicles and based on product as well.
6/8/22, 11:44 AM - +234 817 965 1769: @2348164847452 please check your DM sir
6/8/22, 11:46 AM - +234 703 845 5619: This message was deleted
6/8/22, 11:49 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Hmmm 🤔
6/8/22, 11:49 AM - +234 703 845 5619: please to clarify boss....

this would return aggregated row for an annual payment right? 

system captures 3 rows for annual payment with the same created date and the amount for each row. 

This first model would return one row for an annual payment with start date as payment date and end date as 12 months later and amount the total amount?

right?
6/8/22, 11:52 AM - +234 703 845 5619: and so a unique row for a unique subscription and can have multiple customers. right?
6/8/22, 12:01 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The dynamic of having multiple subscription based on products don change the logic I get for my head 😂
6/8/22, 12:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Since there is possibility of multiple subscription. 

Let this table include product_type. 

So the granularity will be subscription/customer/product (use can use this later to create a surrogate key)
6/8/22, 12:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Yes Boss
6/8/22, 12:04 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Please message @2347033167142 and @2348108522573 too
6/8/22, 12:06 PM - +234 703 845 5619: okay boss, thank you
6/8/22, 12:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The amount will be the actual monthly amount not the aggregated
6/8/22, 12:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So you will find a way to write the logic for annual where 

subscription_id | customer | product | start date | end date | amount 

1 | A | X | 2022-06-08 | 2023-06-08 | $20

The $20 is the monthly rate for that subscription 
A
6/8/22, 12:14 PM - +234 806 457 9841: <Media omitted>
6/8/22, 12:19 PM - +234 703 845 5619: okay, so boss please for clarification.. how do we now get revenue for months in between start and end date if they are not captured on this model?
6/8/22, 12:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Next approach after transforming the source data to reflect the above. 

Create a Date spine model to reflect one record per customer per product per month 


To create this. 

Create a utility date dimension for each months from your db start date to current date (use dbt_utils.datespine) 

Then use that date dimension to create the the monthly/product/customer subscription data. However, it’s a bit tricky with your use case so you will need to factor in month in-between when there was no activity/subscription for a particular customer/product

To help you can create an helper column to identify status change (more like active, church, reactivation ) using the scenario I painted for myself (Jan - April, I’m active, May - September *churn* and October - I reacted my plan for that particular product since your own case have a dynamic of multiple instances)
6/8/22, 12:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s a crazy model 😂😂😂😂
6/8/22, 12:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I no envy you this month
6/8/22, 12:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: My head don dey pain me sef racking my head 😂😂
6/8/22, 12:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The next approach will answer that.
6/8/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Thank you boss, my first approach did not work hence my plea for help.. 😭😅
6/8/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 845 5619: I get it now sir
6/8/22, 12:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Let create a sample 

Step 1 - output of your data looks like this after transforming it 
Customer A product X subscription quarterly , start date 2022-01-01  amount 20

Step 2 - spin fan out with the date spine 

2022-01-01 A X 20 active 
2022-02-01 A X 20 active
2022-03-01 A X 20 active 

April to Sept- I churned

2022-04-01 A X 20 churned
2022-05-01 A X 20 churned 
…

2022-10-01 A X 20 reactivation
…
6/8/22, 12:30 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This will be the behavior for all customer and products. 

To get the monthly MRR you can easily sum amount for each month filtered on active
6/8/22, 12:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Next approach will be communicated later 

My head dey bang make I go start work. 

 I believe that should give some pointer
6/8/22, 12:31 PM - +234 703 845 5619: waoooo this is amazing

6/8/22, 12:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The model can get complicated 

What if stakeholders want to know the behavior of change ? from active to churn 😂😂

Just have that in mind for the future or another AE will continue the work after you don leave 😂😂😂.
6/8/22, 12:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na this kind model dey frustrate 😂😂
6/8/22, 12:36 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Anytime bro. 

Once you have done step 1&2. 

We will think next approach. 

I’m already thinking of a probable route though I don’t know how that will play out. 

Let’s see where you get for the steps above.
6/8/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 845 5619: 🤣 abi o... I can't come and kee myself lolz
6/8/22, 12:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Hope you didn’t tell them I will get back to you before noon 😂😂
6/8/22, 12:41 PM - +234 703 845 5619: lolzzzzzzzzzzz for where?  I started working on this last week lolzzz......... my results no jive at all... I just tell them say I am working on it o lolzz
6/8/22, 12:41 PM - +234 706 439 6712: In one of my research studies, I used a Markov model to study the Switching/Churning behaviors of GSM service providers in a particular location in Nigeria, collected raw data from a survey I conducted,  insights were drawn and predictions were made, for Quarterly churns, Annuals and possible long time behavior.
6/8/22, 12:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do a lot of testing and validation for duplications. So factor in writing test for your MRR model. 

Well done.
6/8/22, 12:43 PM - +234 703 845 5619: waoo... nice
6/8/22, 12:44 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🫡
6/8/22, 12:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Don’t expose this table to your downstream user. 

Materialize it as ephemeral
6/8/22, 12:44 PM - +234 706 439 6712: We would however, need to study rate of churns or retentions to a subscription, 


N what network subscriber would most likely have the highest customers retentions , owing to several factors
6/8/22, 12:44 PM - +234 703 845 5619: My oga, after your post on DUPS yesterday, I run go put test on some of my models wey no get test for DUPs before I start to say stories that touch the heart😅😅😅

Def I will add tests

6/8/22, 12:47 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The fear of DUPS is real very real 😂😂😂

As a rule of thumb even if you don’t have any test just check for uniqueness. If it has to make you create a surrogate key when primary key doesn’t exist, do that and test the surrogate key for uniqueness.
6/8/22, 12:48 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Nice... as I was looking at @2348108522573's responses, I started to think probabilistic models might be useful for this too. Markov model is a good place to start but i wonder if for @2347038455619's problem there will be need for a fully specified Markov decision process 🤔

It's interesting to see how these problems can be approached from a variety of techniques.
6/8/22, 12:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The MRR model is building can be used downstream by DS for prediction.
6/8/22, 12:53 PM - +234 703 845 5619: hmmm, I love the way people think here... Great thoughts boss🫡🫡
6/8/22, 12:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: At this phase it can’t work because the state of the data won’t make it possible.

I'll send the problem and sample data here soon. Thanks
6/8/22, 12:58 PM - +234 806 593 5396: You might need to join on multiple conditions...
6/8/22, 1:02 PM - +234 809 183 1446: An organization usually have a budget for a specified time period e.g 2021/01/01 - 2021/06/30
With this information, I'm trying to prepare a time column i'd use for the analysis.

I have tried creating new time periods which fills up the start and end dates, e.g if the start date is 2021/01/01 and ends at 2021/06/30 (ymd), i'd create new time periods for January down to June and those months would have the same budget amount. But, I don't know if that's the best way to approach it.

Any suggestions please?

6/8/22, 1:17 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think you need to investigate that there are no issues with your joins first. If you are sure you are doing the joins rightly, then to remove duplicates, you can select 2 or more of the similar columns then write a row_num over partition by clause in a sub query. Then outside the sub query filter row num to = 1 in a where xlause

6/9/22, 8:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: There are soft skills training courses on LinkedIn learning that can help.

Check out Critical Thinking there.

For analytical thinking, I enjoyed the Introduction to Computational Thinking course on Coursera.


With everything learning, you need to "do" actual work to help cement the principles you learn.

6/9/22, 9:28 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yesss! I know that course. It helped me on some things too.

Analytical thinking to me is being able to break things down, reducing their complexity, solve the parts and build back the whole solution.
6/9/22, 9:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I don’t think there is a course per se that teaches these things actually. I can’t remember taking any for me sha. 


What I will say helped me is basically reading a lot of articles, blogs and conversations of folks to understand how they think and approach a task and subtly I start seeing myself see things differently , so it rub off. I believe that’s the best way rather than going to go and look for one soft skills course. 

Till date I try to read atleast 3 articles or read conversations on random stuffs on slack every day. It just help me see how others think and approach a task, so next time I see a similar task I already have an idea of how to tackle it.
6/9/22, 9:43 AM - +234 703 632 5016: On point……….
Taking those courses too helps
6/9/22, 9:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I didn’t dispute that I just said I didn’t take any 😊
6/9/22, 9:44 AM - +234 903 861 6561: Thanks man
6/9/22, 9:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😊 

Just as @2347031607868 mentioned feel free to ask your question without feeling intimidated. Groups such as this exposes your mind to what is possible and you have access to folks. 


I’m in a group on slack that I barely understand anything they say but I’m still there and in the midst of all their technical jargons one or 2 things sticks.
6/9/22, 9:46 AM - +234 703 806 5681: There are no hard and fast rules to these things.

You'll realise that on some jobs, you thinker deeper than others.

You may find that critical thinking comes more naturally to you than others.

If you're a "big picture" person, it might be less natural than a "details" person.

Learn from others.
Learn by doing.
Learn from feedback.
Take a course if you need to (this also feeds into learning from others, who then give a structured path to how they approach problems)
6/9/22, 9:46 AM - +234 903 861 6561: Thanks for the tips
6/9/22, 9:47 AM - +234 703 632 5016: I get you brov

6/9/22, 9:48 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The reason I didn’t opt for the course option is because it’s generic and wNt be targeted to Data as such may not be helpful like that. 

My take sha
6/9/22, 9:48 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: ~wNt~
*may
6/9/22, 9:49 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Courses don't have to relate to data tbh.

It can relate to anything.

Soft skills are life skills.
6/9/22, 9:49 AM - +234 818 047 2075: This message was deleted
6/9/22, 9:50 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not 💯 true sha. 

You may need to learn some stuff in the context of what you need it for. Communication skills maybe you don’t but critical and analytical thinking you sure need to learn in the context of what you want to do.
6/9/22, 9:50 AM - +234 818 047 2075: This helps alot. 

A few books that I have read and think can help indirectly.
* Naked statistics by Charles Wheelman
* Calling Bullshit - Art of skepticism in a data world by Carl Bergstrom
* You are not so smart by David Mcraney 
*Numerate life by John Paulos

I haven't read the Numerator life book but I plan to. Heard it is a good one
6/9/22, 9:50 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s why books targeted to soft skills in Data will be much better than a general soft skills book or course.
6/9/22, 9:52 AM - +234 703 806 5681: You use critical and analytical thinking for more stuff than Data.

This point, I stand by.

And asking someone to look for data-specific courses isn't particularly helpful, really.

Contextual learning isn't a bad thing. But I'm always understanding general application (life-skill), then digging deeper into work-specifics.
6/9/22, 9:53 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Anyway, the person that asked, I've shared a link for LinkedIn Learning.

There was a second one. Will share when I find it.
6/9/22, 9:53 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I didn’t disprove your submission really. I’m just responding in context of David’s question which reference Data.
6/9/22, 9:53 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Forgot to add
Your deceptive mind: A scientific guide to critical thinking skills by The great courses on Audible.

It is also a very good one
6/9/22, 9:56 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Someone recommend this Calling Bullshit- Art of skepticism to me and it's really nice to be honest
6/9/22, 9:56 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Digging deeper into work specific isn’t inferior either if you are a more generalist really. 

And yes, I will recommend learning critical thinking and analytical mindset to Data from standpoint of analytics rather than generic if that’s what the person want to learn as it relate ti analytics
6/9/22, 9:56 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Do you have the PDF sir?
Calling Bullshit-
6/9/22, 9:57 AM - +234 818 047 2075: No I typically just buy on Audible

6/9/22, 9:58 AM - +234 818 047 2075: What is read aloud option?
6/9/22, 9:58 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I didn't say it's inferior, dear.

I meant I like approaching things from a generic view point, then digging deeper into specifics.
6/9/22, 9:58 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Ehn I'm sure it has a name, but don't remember 😩

6/9/22, 9:59 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Is Audible audio book?
6/9/22, 9:59 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes it is
6/9/22, 9:59 AM - +234 703 806 5681: How much is subscription?
6/9/22, 9:59 AM - +234 818 047 2075: So I basically just listen in. I typically do other things while listening. Then I take notes where necessary. All on my phone.
6/9/22, 10:00 AM - +234 818 047 2075: $15 per month
6/9/22, 10:00 AM - +234 818 047 2075: You get a free book every month.
6/9/22, 10:00 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Then they do sales too
6/9/22, 10:00 AM - +234 703 806 5681: 🤧
My monthly subscriptions don plenty
6/9/22, 10:00 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And like you said no hard and fast rules. 

I didn’t take any course or book on generic critical thinking. I shared my approach that helped me till date. Atleast I can’t remember reading any book on how to thin critically or analytically 

Another person may choose another option that suit them. I guess that’s the interesting about learning that there is no fixed rule. And that’s why I didn’t respond as an authority but more as an opinion

6/10/22, 11:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nah

This is for Data Management kinda and not for Data professional per se.
6/10/22, 11:40 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 👀
6/10/22, 11:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The fact that the data space is a fast paced one, it’s going to be hard to have a professional body to govern it. I believe it’s going to thrive the way it has been thriving as an open source community.
6/10/22, 11:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Wetin do you?

6/10/22, 11:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah. 

And DASCA I know you had certificate from there (American ish). To what I can inference is just an organization trying to regulate and standardized things with the certification
6/10/22, 11:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *infer
6/10/22, 11:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/10/22, 11:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The Data and tech space value your worth based on your skills and competence not certification. 

You can add skill specific certification to validate your skills later if you choose for personal brag and not because employer will price you higher for having those creds.
6/10/22, 11:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I doubt if there will ever be a body  like ICAN and all for Data folks sha, I may be wrong. 

The idea to say get this degree and you are recognized as a Data expert for clearing some curriculum will be hard because the data world is wild 💀💀 where courses and tutorial is different from real world with crazy varying use cases that won’t be thought of to be factored into any curriculum.

Why AZ discuss and introduce you to the entire Azure ecosystem.

AI is specify to Azure AI services and rendering

6/11/22, 10:07 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Not quite.

We know the economy thrived somewhat under Obj, and continued into Yar'adua.
Then GEJ got into a bit of the action before awon looters began helping themselves to oil money. And Buhari managed to take us back 20 years.
6/11/22, 10:08 AM - +234 703 806 5681: There's an ongoing twitter space now relation to our debt-gdp

Are there other things that we need to look at, may be the rate of looting or other factors?

I'll really appreciated if you can help me get more context at your convenient time.

6/13/22, 12:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: How does depreciation work in Nigeria, especially for Toyota cars.

How come a person can buy a foreign used Toyota Corolla in year 1 and still sell it at about 50/60% of the value after 4 years?

@2347038065681 and finance pros pls can you explain this.
6/13/22, 12:27 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I think this depends on the Toyota Car , the Demand for the model type and the Dollar too.

Demand and Dollar actually
6/13/22, 12:27 PM - +234 816 484 7452: With Custom charges and import duties
6/13/22, 12:28 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Recently Custom increased charges and import duties ridiculously 

So anyone selling or trying to value a car takes this into consideration

6/13/22, 1:07 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Oh I see. So the actual price keeps moving up
6/13/22, 1:07 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It will keep moving up or appreciating sadly 😞
6/13/22, 1:08 PM - +234 816 484 7452: People who bought their cars 2 years ago and below are the real winners here because they can resell and make profit
6/13/22, 1:12 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Makes sense now 👌

6/13/22, 1:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's resale value, not necessarily depreciation.

And the market assigns the value. One important factor is "demand"
6/13/22, 1:23 PM - +234 818 047 2075: So depreciation says you lose some value each year due to usage
6/13/22, 1:23 PM - +234 818 047 2075: That value could be some where between 15 and 20% per year
6/13/22, 1:25 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I would expect that after 4 years that resale value drops to 20% or 30% or less
6/13/22, 1:25 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Depreciation is hypothetically assigned. There are no standard rates for it.

And on an annual basis, you can revalue an asset and start depreciating again.

So... even at disposal, you still need to check for resale value (scrap value). Which is technically what happens with cars.
6/13/22, 1:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: No. You're not the market and the market isn't you.

Think of this as Accounting meets Economics.
6/13/22, 1:26 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Oh I see
6/13/22, 1:26 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hmmm 🙌🙌🙌
6/13/22, 1:26 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Makes sense
6/13/22, 1:26 PM - +234 818 047 2075: So the market forces will be what @2348164847452 was referring too right?
6/13/22, 1:27 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Yes. Demand and Supply.

Price affects this at a granular level.

And other factors like custom duties etc, can affect the price.

6/13/22, 1:36 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Let’s use a real life example

DS is not for the faint of heart.

Have you seen roles like Data Scientist (Optimization)? Most of them specifically require you to have PhD in Operations Research or Mathematics or CS.

Or MSc in these areas, with like 3 years of experience working on optimization problems. Entry level left the group chat 😭
6/13/22, 9:02 PM - Condil: Throughout the time I was thinking of proceeding in it, I no for once get rest of mind🤣🤣😂
6/13/22, 9:03 PM - +234 810 644 0791: 😂😂😂
6/13/22, 9:03 PM - +234 813 556 4853: 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
6/13/22, 9:03 PM - +234 904 894 6475: You can. Just make sure you exhaust one graduate level textbook in Operations Research. The problem is the commitment to finish, that's why an MSc or PhD in that area is preferred.
6/13/22, 9:05 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I would love to do more research in Stochastic modeling ( one aspect in Operations Research)  at MSc or PhD. Level....

Fully-funded scholarship, in US or UK...

I don't have an MSc though     but I have special interest in all tinz scholastic.
6/13/22, 9:05 PM - +234 706 439 6712: If anyone has an offer or opportunity, kindly reach out to me.
6/13/22, 9:05 PM - +234 904 894 6475: And oh, graduate level textbooks on OR are theoretical. So your approach will be to implement the concepts in code.

6/13/22, 9:06 PM - Condil: Linear programming, constrained, conic, 😂🤣, the headache too much. But it all together forms an interesting part of Prescriptive analytics

6/13/22, 9:07 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes, optimization is the heart of prescriptive analytics.
6/13/22, 9:07 PM - Condil: Yeah, decision science altogether.
6/13/22, 9:14 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I think Data science should be introduced in our schools
6/13/22, 9:16 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Teach students concepts, from areas of application... And not some unstructured irrelevance Gibberish
6/13/22, 9:16 PM - +234 904 894 6475: That's just the most practical thing. Data science training can actually span 4 years. By the time you are done, you are fully equipped for the rigours of the field.
6/13/22, 9:18 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly.. 12 months of training is not  enough to call yourself a professional or certified data scientist

Data science is better than that .
6/13/22, 9:19 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Bigger *
6/13/22, 9:20 PM - +234 909 130 5248: First the rudiments of data have to be taught before teaching Data Science
6/13/22, 9:20 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I was about to say that 🤣

Data science curriculum at university level can only be correctly delivered by experienced professionals in the field who also have experience in teaching. As opposed to lecturers who just have the theoretical knowledge and probably even decade-old methodologies that are no longer practical in the ever-evolving landscape of data.
6/13/22, 9:20 PM - +234 909 130 5248: If someone don’t understand data, how will the person know how to solve optimization problems??
6/13/22, 9:30 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Imagine, in my year 1, one  of our  lecturers told us, "By the time you are done, as a statistics  student, you should be  know at least  2000 formulas ". .. All of us were like wtf....

2000 kini? ..


At the start, some of us were just competing for high grades, but we were never actually learning statistics. It was in my year 3,  I had a lecturer called. He observed I was among those  good in solving questions n getting marks.....  But when it came to interpreting the data or the analysis, we all became dumb, we couldn't make any sense of what were solving. That was when I knew I needed to do some personal work  


A lot of us graduates don't  know anything... We only know formulas n know how to solve this n how to solve that..  But the basic concept and driving meaning / Insights from our analysis, that knowledge is far from us.

I had to self-study, asking questions of why and why not.  That was how I began to gradually began to  understand how tinz actually work , in real life
6/13/22, 9:32 PM - +234 706 439 6712: That's correct
6/13/22, 9:33 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Truer than true .👍🏻
6/13/22, 9:34 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Reading this just made me remember the book "Head First Statistics".

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to really, really understand statistical concepts up to probability distributions and hypothesis testing. It's the best introductory text I ever read.
6/13/22, 9:34 PM - +234 706 439 6712: No way ,boss

6/13/22, 9:57 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Yup I can attest to this.
Did Economics in school. Plenty theoretical nonsense talk.

Took one MITx micromasters on Edx and was like "sh*t, I didn't learn Jack in school 😶"

Applied microeconomics was INSANE.
6/13/22, 9:57 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Amen
6/13/22, 9:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Happy birthday to your mum.
6/13/22, 10:04 PM - +234 706 439 6712: The sad part is, the situation is growing worst , as most of our younger ones are longer interested in school or even  learning... Everyone wants sharp money...

I fear for the coming generation .
6/13/22, 10:05 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Thanks , dear 🙏🏼

6/14/22, 8:01 AM - +234 816 296 3527: You're not alone in this. Studied Statistics as well. 

Remember Statistical Theory. We call that course copy and paste. You just have to find a way to memorise the theorems and pour them back to the lecturer.

Most of the theorems didn't make sense because the lecturer couldn't explain as well.

Numerical methods sitting in a league of its own. 🥵

Online courses came to the rescue after school though. But I wish something can be done about how our teachers teach. Because the courses they taught us were relevant but mostly theoretical and lacked depth. They also discourage new ideas and methods that are not present in the books they copy from.

I remember that they usually hide the text book they teach from. This reminds me of Operations research and Experimentation.
6/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Bluman is also a good book for Statistics
6/14/22, 8:04 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Fundamentals of Statistics by Gupta
6/14/22, 8:07 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Design and Experimental analysis

6/14/22, 8:15 AM - +234 706 439 6712: I a lot of shit going on, in our schools
6/14/22, 8:16 AM - +234 706 439 6712: 🤣....

"Discourage new ideas " ..

That's the main part, for me.

I ran into problem a few times with 2 of my lecturers because i asked some questions they couldn't supply answer to, I never asked to challenge or make gist of him. But baba took it personal. When I realized his wasn't happy, I stopped asking questions, in class all together, I just do my personal study, and pretend everything taught in class was correct, even when I noticed mistakes....


Na to comot with good grades n den later do my own personal work... I stopped attending some classes..


Imagine using outdated notes other lecturers have been using , since the 1980's, to teach , in 2000's...
6/14/22, 8:19 AM - +234 816 424 7582: This Gupta guy!!! 🤣 If it's the same Gupta I know that wrote most of the Textbooks then I have to Cut cap for him already! 
"Gupta" Is just in major textbook...
6/14/22, 8:21 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Those India scholars ehn
6/14/22, 8:22 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Every Nigerian student can relate😔...and Sadly it's not just Stat....

it cuts across all course's....

Don't even mention Computer based courses...

Comp Eng and Comp Sci....

Those ones,  Na Abacus dem still dey use dey teach gan!
6/14/22, 8:23 AM - +234 810 831 6393: You get luck say you discovered on time. One of my own lecturers took it personal, bàbà downgraded me in his courses he took two courses that semester. I follow am drag say I no fit ever get below B in the two courses. Alaye said that I do challenge him for class, na so I succumbed jejely
6/14/22, 8:23 AM - +234 706 439 6712: The guys is good.. I have some of his collection, in my archives
6/14/22, 8:25 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Stat own too much boss (maybe na because that's what I studied), but the guys are not opened to new ideas. They just come to the class to teach crap (mostly what they were taught in their own days)
6/14/22, 8:26 AM - +234 706 439 6712: God bless you..

U sabi the gist well well..
6/14/22, 8:26 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Ur right , sir.
6/14/22, 8:26 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Amen 🙏 and you too boss
6/14/22, 8:27 AM - +234 803 420 2314: Back then in LASU, the lecturer that took the operations research course didn't even know what he was teaching; the whole class failed that course even the best students sef. It was scrapped afterwards.
6/14/22, 8:28 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Those Stat lecturers are something. One saw me doing a data analysis gig for a PhD student while I was in 300L, bàbà said it's the reason they don't teach us analysis. He said I was in 300L and already making money from statistical analysis 😤
6/14/22, 8:29 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Like say na him teach me the one I know before
6/14/22, 8:29 AM - +234 803 420 2314: Imagine bad vibes from a lecturer
6/14/22, 8:29 AM - +234 810 831 6393: They (Statistics lecturers) always feel threatened by the emergence of the younger generation.
6/14/22, 8:30 AM - +234 816 424 7582: I think the Fundamental problem is that no one actually wants to teach University in the Uni anymore...

Its Just a sacrifice to do so...no young good head would want to sacrifice remote Job for lecturing in LASU or what not....

The Academic environment in Nigeria is generally repulsive for Talents...even if you have. Passion to teach, one would rather do it off Uni walls...
6/14/22, 8:30 AM - +234 803 420 2314: That is because it's difficult at their age to learn something new.
6/14/22, 8:30 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Can this be fixed at all?
6/14/22, 8:31 AM - +234 803 420 2314: I doubt that...
6/14/22, 8:31 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Lollz....it's a fundamental issue walahi....😅
6/14/22, 8:32 AM - +234 810 831 6393: My former HOD at Futminna killed an idea that could have opened up opportunities for a lot of us back in 2018, but thank God he did sha 😂
6/14/22, 8:33 AM - +234 816 424 7582: The ASSU matter makes this consideration worse...
6/14/22, 8:34 AM - +234 810 831 6393: The new VC (now outgoing) wanted to establish the Institute of Statistical Computing in Futminna, and he was looking at recruiting graduates from Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science department, but the old man (my HOD) killed the idea on arrival
6/14/22, 8:35 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Man said he wouldn't be making more money if the institute were to be created. Hence, the idea is not welcomed 💔
6/14/22, 8:38 AM - +234 803 420 2314: Hahaha!
Do you know some lecturers can't use a computer; how would they learn use a computer let alone python or piwer bi
6/14/22, 8:38 AM - +234 810 831 6393: My HOD is one of stuck professors 😂😅
6/14/22, 8:39 AM - +234 805 365 5849: Statistics is taught in Nigeria without software?
6/14/22, 8:39 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Bàbá muted his laptop, complained to me that his 💻 isn't producing sound
6/14/22, 8:40 AM - +234 810 831 6393: They'll teach you R and maybe little SPSS (if you are lucky)
6/14/22, 8:40 AM - +234 706 439 6712: I had a folder of about 18GIg back den.

Na Youtube video tutorials full am. Mostly Indian guys..n others explaining and teaching what most of our lecturers couldn't...


More 70% of what I know in math/stat. Were from Youtube, Google , texbooks and group study with few friends..
6/14/22, 8:42 AM - +234 810 831 6393: As in ehn, textbooks, YouTube, Google et al
6/14/22, 8:43 AM - +234 706 439 6712: In the US, uk, and other foreign schools, students and their professors discuss ideas, while taking cafe  ...
6/14/22, 8:43 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Though I was lucky then, one of my lecturers picked interests in me. I had access to his personal library then and as a matter of fact, his office was technically my office
6/14/22, 8:44 AM - +234 810 831 6393: He was a great blessing to my life and career
6/14/22, 8:44 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Na y I must travel out..n study in either Cambridge, Princeton or Stanford...

6/14/22, 8:58 AM - +234 810 831 6393: James did not teach us. He was taking lower levels when we were in school
6/14/22, 8:59 AM - +234 810 831 6393: The day he got to know that the former VC is my uncle, dude calmed down. But wetin concern me with him matter?
6/14/22, 8:59 AM - +234 905 937 1240: Ọmọ,James na shaa náà 🔥, the lecturer sabi  theory and he knows how to teach as well, he's going for his PhD in machine learning as well this year

6/14/22, 9:00 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Your people even know SPSs....they had to hire an external Peterson to teach us....

6/14/22, 9:02 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Sadly this seems to be a thing. I failed stats in 200L cause of this. About 70% failed. The remaining 30% that passed score between 40 and 50. Only 2 people got 50. When we went to meet the lecturer, she said we should be happy, that she even added 10 marks across board 💀💀.

6/14/22, 9:17 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Audu said as long as he remained the HOD, if at all there'll ever be a 1st class in the department, it can't exceed 1, and 2:1 won't exceed 3
6/14/22, 9:17 AM - +234 905 937 1240: Yakubu no get time
Truth is, he's good but if you ain't good as well you will find his class boring

6/14/22, 9:19 AM - +234 810 831 6393: That's Yakubu for you. He won't take classes more than thrice or Max of 4 times
6/14/22, 9:19 AM - +234 818 415 3106: 😂😂😂see ehn lets not start with some of the life we lived then.

6/14/22, 9:55 AM - +234 810 831 6393: The man whose face is opened is Jimmy Fatoki, I have a good relationship with him on Facebook until sometimes around 2019 when I quit Facebook
6/14/22, 9:56 AM - +234 814 113 9601: oh, wow
6/14/22, 9:57 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Yeah, both of them are from my state though, but I never had any encounter with Lagbaja
6/14/22, 9:59 AM - +234 814 113 9601: oh well, my search continues.
6/14/22, 10:45 AM - +234 816 296 3527: There were students that didn't bother coming to class.

They had seniors that graduated from the department. So they took their notes and curated solutions for all known past questions. Memories, pour in the exam hall, and pass.
6/14/22, 10:50 AM - +234 816 296 3527: Computer Science. We had a lecturer that downloaded questions from the internet. That semester we were covering DBMS (relational databases). 

The students from the Computer Science department failed his test because some of the questions were from topics they had not touched.

Someone figured that the questions were from a website. The website has over 10k questions on relational databases.

All Yiu had to do was download and print the questions, and then answer them as many times as possible.

Practice makes perfect.

That's how you get good grades. I got extra marks for doing better than the students in the Department of Computer Science.
6/14/22, 10:50 AM - +234 909 130 5248: This is a lie sha
6/14/22, 10:54 AM - +234 810 831 6393: The system is messed up bro. ASUU demands are genuine. I've seen young academics leave 9ja for a saner academic society
6/14/22, 11:02 AM - +234 706 439 6712: If na u unko ?

Uni days were crazy
6/14/22, 11:06 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Those who went to private schools can hardly relate
6/14/22, 11:06 AM - +234 909 130 5248: They aren’t genuine, all they want is for FG to accept UTAS, all other demands are by products
6/14/22, 11:07 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Your take
6/14/22, 11:07 AM - +234 706 439 6712: But some of us way go pubic school....


It's well
6/14/22, 11:07 AM - +234 810 831 6393: When did UTAS surfaced, no be recently (PMB regime)?
6/14/22, 11:08 AM - +234 810 831 6393: The clamor has been on since 2009 if you care to know
6/14/22, 11:08 AM - +234 816 296 3527: Should we talk about the text books?😭

They downloaded loads of unedited content from the internet and compiled it as a text book. We paid for it.

No thought was put into the book, this means you're likely to get lost because of repetition, multiple font types and sizes..
6/14/22, 11:08 AM - +234 703 786 9165: sorry, who get AC again?
6/14/22, 11:08 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Bàbá, if you fit survive federal uni in 9ja, you fit survive anywhere

6/14/22, 11:11 AM - +234 810 831 6393: We eventually found that both men dubbed, Introduction to Quality Control, a Montgomery series 🤌
6/14/22, 11:12 AM - +234 816 296 3527: This one loud
6/14/22, 11:13 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Astute scholars wey dey 9ja universities no plenty. Most of them are photocopy machine

6/14/22, 11:16 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Lemme use this to hold body
6/14/22, 11:16 AM - +234 810 831 6393: At least 5 of my uncles are ASUU members (3 are professors kuma). You can't tell me IPPIS isn't a scam bàbà
6/14/22, 11:17 AM - +234 909 130 5248: ASUU
6/14/22, 11:17 AM - +234 706 439 6712: However, it all boils down to you as an individual to work on yourself, personally.

School Systems would always be school systems. The government would always be government...


Find a way around the odds , to succeed . The blame game only hurt and destroy one person ;YOU!
6/14/22, 11:17 AM - +234 810 831 6393: How?
6/14/22, 11:17 AM - +234 909 130 5248: Nobody said it isn’t, all I’m saying is that ASUU can’t tell FG to choose their own tool
6/14/22, 11:18 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Why introduce a system that steals people's money?
6/14/22, 11:18 AM - +234 810 831 6393: If IPPIS wasn't introduced, UTAS wouldn't have surfaced bàbà

6/14/22, 12:58 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Where is xlookup?
6/14/22, 12:58 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Me sef no see am. I was wondering...
6/14/22, 1:22 PM - +234 803 420 2314: Xlookup is only on 365. I doubt they'll incorporate it into the offline product. Besides, *index and match* almost does exactly what xlookup can do.
6/14/22, 1:23 PM - +234 818 415 3106: vlookup also
6/14/22, 1:24 PM - +234 803 420 2314: I disagree kinda, vlookup is very limited
6/14/22, 1:25 PM - +234 818 415 3106: toor
6/14/22, 1:25 PM - +234 803 420 2314: Why 'toor-ing' 🤔
6/14/22, 1:31 PM - +234 703 786 9165: actually, vlookup and hlookup does what xlookup is doing.
6/14/22, 1:32 PM - +234 818 415 3106: na why i talk toor
6/14/22, 1:32 PM - +234 703 786 9165: I just find xlookup to be straightforward and I dont need to create chains of formula to get things to work
6/14/22, 1:34 PM - +234 703 786 9165: also, if you're using office 2016, you should be able to use xlookup even on the offline version.
6/14/22, 1:39 PM - +234 818 415 3106: Nah i don't think so jare
6/14/22, 1:43 PM - +234 803 420 2314: It isn't on 2016
6/14/22, 1:43 PM - +234 803 420 2314: Offline version I mean. It isn't there.
6/14/22, 1:43 PM - +234 816 296 3527: You need office 365
6/14/22, 1:46 PM - +234 803 420 2314: I ain't trying to argue but can vlookup and hlookup choose columns in an un-sequenced manner? Because I have come across xlookup been used to do that while I was learning its functionality sometime ago.
6/14/22, 1:47 PM - +234 813 747 4240: w are you doing
6/14/22, 1:47 PM - +234 818 415 3106: baba  xlookup was used to correct the shortcomings of vlookup and hlookup
6/14/22, 1:47 PM - +234 813 747 4240: How
6/14/22, 1:48 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Who has used Datacamp to learn PowerBI

6/14/22, 1:59 PM - +234 703 786 9165: maybe the laptop I used had office 365 hidden somewhere in it then.

How do you manage working on long term data tasks like modelling and infrastructure building with daily ad-hoc "quick analysis"  requests. 

I feel like this is a major distraction since the value level is not very high compared to the value of long/mid term valued tasks. 

Boss, what's your advice? 

Et all
6/14/22, 7:04 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You gerrit😂😂😂, that's the drill.

6/14/22, 7:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Create a ticket approach. 

Discuss with all stakeholders to drop there adhoc requests before a certain time 2pm as an example and let them know when it will be ready. 

Inform them any request that doesn’t come in before your set time will be deprioritized till the next day. 

You can then allocate some few hours within the day to address the requests. And you can also have a day set aside for infrastructure work and let them know that day you aren’t attending to any request
6/14/22, 7:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You will do a lot of talking and learning to say NO. 

They will be chasing you upandown to attend to their request. I can remember someone buying me cookies so I can attend to his team request 😂
6/14/22, 7:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So just learn to be in-charge and do proper communication with all the affected stakeholders.
6/14/22, 7:22 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Okay, boss, I will work on this..

6/15/22, 7:19 AM - +234 703 316 7142: What are the advantages of using Azure purview and profisee for data governance?
6/15/22, 7:31 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Profisee and Microsoft Purview does more than Data Cataloguing.


It's better to see the need for overall governance because the moment you are done with cataloguing, more governance topic will come up and if the tool isn't robust enough to address those needs, you end up spending twice, this time around costlier than before.

Let's start from there.

In terms of cost, Microsoft Purview is cheaper compared to tools like Collibra.

I did some backward reversibility accessment on this tool in the past and overall, Microsoft Purview stood out for us.

Speaking to Integration: If your organisation uses Microsoft Services, you will enjoy native integration with Purview. 

With Microsoft Purview, you have access to
1. Automated Scanning and Data Classification
2. Data Insights (Data Use Report)
3. Data Catalog (Business Glossary)
4. Data Lineage
5. Data Map (Data Assets, Lineage, Classification)

From my experience and use of Purview, it provides a unified approach to data governance.

Some features are still in Private and Public preview but if you have access to them, then you see the following:

Data Catalog
Managing Data Sharing
Data Quality
Master Data
Data Use Governance
And Data Privacy

6/15/22, 9:12 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Purview do support OnPrem. Just that it will run on the cloud.

You will install integration runtime on your OnPrem and use this to connect.

It will automatically scan all tables on your connected data sources and keep them for glossary, classification, and lineage tracking. Good for metadata management too

🌻So, you will define Business Rules.
🌻 create Data Quality Metrics from the business rules
🌻Then create thresholds from the Quality Metrics.


Finally, your SQL Engine 😁.
1. Create table for business domain and data field
2. Create another table to store data quality rules and metrics with thresholds.

These tables are relational.

This will make your data quality activities programmable as you have parameterised the fields involved. It becomes easier to also scale. You can expand across different domains. 
Customer, Products, Agents, etc..

The last part is implementation, you can use any programming language here, I only have experience with C# implementation and SQL.

You can write SQL Stored Procedures functions to evaluate each data quality rules picking rules, values, and thresholds dynamically from the tables and store the results in another table which gets plugged to Power BI for visualisation.

6/15/22, 11:04 AM - +234 706 057 7846: or create send a chat to a Teams Group and create a Task in Planner, assign it to the concerned stakeholder, update a sharepoint list for tracking data quality issues, etc...

6/15/22, 6:43 PM - +234 806 593 5396: From the formula bar, you can manually edit the code to return your expected result.
6/15/22, 6:56 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. It's simply because I have seen it happen over and over again in this my data career. I start learning this tool then one of these giants personalize it. It has so much happened that I believe it will always happen 😅
6/15/22, 7:12 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I am freaking laughing here 🤣😂🤣

Please need help on this

I'm trying to plot set of data  using excel(see attachment below) and.  My system display this (Excel cannot complete this task with available resources, choose less data or close other applications) when I try to run the data .

6/15/22, 9:06 PM - Richie: The annoying thing is cte don’t work on most visualization tool. If your company doesn’t allow you create lots of viewssss then you will need to write crazy sub query in sub queryies let’s just say sub zero

6/15/22, 9:09 PM - +234 905 555 4527: He really didn’t have to come for spaghetti like that.

6/15/22, 9:11 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/15/22, 9:11 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Those ones na for testing nah😅

6/15/22, 9:24 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I agree that MDS has its drawbacks. It is already eliminating a major friction by offering speed with downstream transformations, but the problem is with long-term sustainability. Heap of technical debt, barely representative data model, etc etc.
6/15/22, 9:25 PM - +234 706 057 7846: Nobody should make me laugh this night o 😄

6/15/22, 10:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: CTEs don’t work on visualization??
6/15/22, 10:35 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Wetin MDS do for this guy 😂😂😂
6/15/22, 10:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: There’s been a lot of debates in the data space at the moment about it. 

When new initiatives come up, it also come with its own side and troubles. More chaos, more demand for skilled folks and more money 🤭

We will continue to follow how things goes.
6/15/22, 10:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Another tool or technology will come up in a couple of years -  “fixing the modern Data stack flaws” 😂😂

6/15/22, 10:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data modeling is actually very critical and seem to be the brain behind proper Data warehousing work. 

All respect to the father of DW himself Daddy “Khimball”. Remove a proper DM in a data warehouse work, it’s actually chaotic and a mess. 

There are a lot of bottlenecks that make it a difficult. I think the major issue with the MDS is the “JOIN PROBLEM”. Integrating  data from multiple sources create a bottleneck that now require complex queries to build a model for a metric. 

Wooo las las I will leave this Data back to Elect 😕

6/15/22, 10:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yeah, believe the next big thing will be a paradigm that merges the best things about classical data warehousing and those of the modern data stack
6/15/22, 10:53 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I* believe
6/15/22, 10:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m sure one startup is cooking it up 😂😂😂
6/15/22, 11:35 PM - Richie: Ya “some”
AWS QuickSight for sure 
Then I think Tableau and PowerBI too.. 

Or is there anyone that has used it with the above ?

R gurus please help 

Good morning
6/16/22, 7:06 AM - +234 906 092 6282: R can't find probably the whole data in its memory
6/16/22, 7:06 AM - +234 906 092 6282: He should reload the data
6/16/22, 7:07 AM - +234 803 353 6901: All right

6/16/22, 7:31 AM - +234 906 092 6282: But he hasn't added the data frame too. He should take note
6/16/22, 7:32 AM - +234 803 353 6901: All right

6/16/22, 9:06 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Just dial *141# and check the first option for your Offers.

To see if Airtel is giving you bonus.

If there's no option for that, 20gb for 5k.
MTN & Airtel Plans are technically the same.

I currently subscribe on both because of location changes too.
6/16/22, 9:07 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Spend this money

6/16/22, 9:20 AM - +234 703 806 5681: This is cool. What's the code?
6/16/22, 9:21 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You made the right choice actually a very critical state. 

If probably would have been a different story if you went for money then. 

Learning point for newbies : Sometimes free the money and go for quality experience. The ROI will be massive in few years. 

Temi will tell his story better 😂

6/16/22, 9:26 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *Quality* 

Take note of the word. Some experience aren’t quality. So you can evaluate to know if it’s a quality one before opting in.
6/16/22, 9:27 AM - +234 703 350 4764: You can opt in for 
Always on plan 6k for 45gb.per months
6/16/22, 9:27 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Sure
6/16/22, 9:28 AM - +234 816 484 7452: And please add the part of knowing how to market your skills and experience 💯
6/16/22, 9:29 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This one comes later after acquiring the skills. 

You can’t market what you don’t have 😂

You wan dey bid for $2k when na only SELECT * you sabi.
6/16/22, 9:32 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m speaking to newbies/enthusiast so they are aware in case they see quality experience role with shitty pay, to see it as the days of building to gather competence.
6/16/22, 9:33 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/16/22, 9:34 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: My bad I think say na event for women. It’s general.
6/16/22, 9:37 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Let me ask a question on their behalf

*How do you identify quality experience *
6/16/22, 9:37 AM - +234 817 511 5556: https://career5.successfactors.eu/sfcareer/jobreqcareerpvt?jobId=44986&company=C0007596015P&st=FC5B41D946C7628B8256AAB38EAC9B2CB344419D

6/16/22, 9:39 AM - +234 817 511 5556: LinkedIn recruiter ni o
6/16/22, 9:39 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Very good question
6/16/22, 9:39 AM - +234 816 398 2854: I mean the role is HR
6/16/22, 9:40 AM - +234 703 845 5619: Identifying a quality experience may not be easy for a newbie because they don't even know what quality looks like or is about. 

This is where mentorship comes in. Get the assessment of a mentor in your life and they will help you make that decision. 
@2348108522573 did that for me, told me how to get the best out of an experience. 

my thoughts.
6/16/22, 9:40 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Can a novice really differentiate🤷🏾‍♂️

You reached out then because you wanted another idea 💡 from an experienced person as it were about a decision. 

I still do that myself. Before moving to Cowrywise and Data Culture I consulted @2348180472075  who I respect a lot, and he gave his professional advise that aided my decision.

6/16/22, 4:27 PM - +234 703 316 7142: SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN COLUMN1 IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) COL1_NULLS, ...
FROM TABLE
6/16/22, 4:47 PM - +234 814 833 4339: Could be 100
6/16/22, 4:48 PM - +234 814 833 4339: This will do for just 1 column
6/16/22, 4:48 PM - +234 814 833 4339: I need it do for every column
6/16/22, 4:48 PM - +234 814 833 4339: It should  be an equivalent of dataframe.isnull().sum() in pandas
6/16/22, 4:50 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Omo.
Things dy to wer I never learn ooo
6/16/22, 4:51 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Just calm down boss, no be everything you go know 🤣🤣
6/16/22, 4:54 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Oh! This. I don't have an idea yet but you can run a dynamic SQL query that does this or a UDF that can loop through columns to get this done.

The question I will like to ask is what is the significance of knowing the total nulls across all columns? I understand if you are investigating per column.
6/16/22, 4:58 PM - +234 814 833 4339: Let's assume you have 100 columns that are highly consequential to your analysis and you have to run through each column individually to check, its tedious
6/16/22, 4:59 PM - +234 814 833 4339: Also, I guess it just gives you an idea of what your table looks like
6/16/22, 5:01 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Thank you babe.
6/16/22, 5:03 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I'm not saying running one by one, I mean do a count of nulls across all columns and not just summing them up.
6/16/22, 5:04 PM - +234 703 316 7142: In what sense? It's a table and not a matrix.
6/16/22, 5:04 PM - +234 706 439 6712: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE coalesce(col1, col2, col3, ..., colN) IS NULL



Try this
6/16/22, 5:05 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤔
6/16/22, 5:05 PM - +234 706 439 6712: There can be a better way
6/16/22, 5:05 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I'm just thinking how that would work
6/16/22, 5:06 PM - +234 706 439 6712: It should
6/16/22, 5:06 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Remember count(*) is row based, what he is trying to achieve is cell based.
6/16/22, 5:07 PM - S+N Ayoade: 🤔🤔🤔🤔

efficiency though
6/16/22, 5:11 PM - +234 814 833 4339: Would this not add up all the columns listed in the bracket and sum them all up?
6/16/22, 5:16 PM - S+N Ayoade: Na

I think it will just count everything as a single value ..

You’re not grouping by anything to seperate the values for each columns
6/16/22, 5:33 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Once faced this. Eventually resorted to using the python code you put up. Not sure SQL is structured to give you the results without you writing very long and stressful code.
6/16/22, 5:33 PM - +234 818 047 2075: It was a data quality project

That way you can use it as a function anytime you need it

6/16/22, 7:02 PM - +234 818 047 2075: True but some move way faster than others. Data and tech in general are definitely ahead. You probably can't compare them to say accounting.
6/16/22, 7:02 PM - +234 708 675 3621: You probably can
6/16/22, 7:02 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Not probably
6/16/22, 7:02 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Please do
6/16/22, 7:03 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Definitely can
6/16/22, 7:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: At all.  

You may not need to update any knowledge in some field for decades
6/16/22, 7:04 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Then you probably don't like that field in the first place
6/16/22, 7:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not really
6/16/22, 7:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: We are referring to how things are fast paced in the tech world compared to others and not necessarily based on individual not wanting to learn
6/16/22, 7:06 PM - +234 905 555 4527: Thank you, Sirrrrrr.
6/16/22, 7:06 PM - +234 708 145 1890: <Media omitted>
6/16/22, 7:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nobody will force you to learn in Tech. Fear of staying obsolete will force you. 

Some domains all you need as apex is get a degree and that’s it and once a while modus operandi of how things are done can change. Not same in tech
6/16/22, 7:07 PM - +234 708 675 3621: There's this arrogance that comes with us folk in tech that makes us feel like we are pioneers which is not far from the truth but remember every field was at its peak at some point before it became monotonous, it truely takes someone who loves said field to turn the monotony into something of beauty, 

And I get where you're coming from, you're looking at different fields through your tech lens but you forget that learn sometimes you gotta unlearn and step back for a while a field like accounting for example can not be appreciated by someone like you who only sees the tech side of things
6/16/22, 7:11 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Ayodele leave accounting alone 😑
6/16/22, 7:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I think you are getting it wrong. 

This isn’t from a standpoint of under appropriate any profesion really. No one is inferior to another and just like you mentioned passively, everyone won’t do tech and may not love it. 

So the post and conversation didn’t stem to deter love for other professions but rather from how things evolve in the space.
6/16/22, 7:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *under appreciating

6/16/22, 7:13 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You think learning and interpreting IFRS standards dey easy abi

6/16/22, 7:15 PM - +234 806 446 0528: 😄😄😄
6/16/22, 7:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I believe this is the summary of what the post I shared was geared towards @2347086753621 

So it’s not saying folks in the accounting space don’t learn or anything. 

Another person may not like tech because of that fast paced nature to constant keep up with things and learn new stuff and all which can be overwhelming and stressing really. So no one is discrediting any profession really
6/16/22, 7:16 PM - +234 806 446 0528: After this, some countries no dey use ifrs self. You gast learn their standard
6/16/22, 7:16 PM - +234 703 806 5681: But if they're a public company you'll use your local GAAP for the local accounts and translate to IFRS for the Group account.
6/16/22, 7:17 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Make one yeye mistake and someone will wake up one day and sue you or your company will lose market shares because you want to adjust it.

6/16/22, 7:18 PM - +234 708 675 3621: The original thing that caused this argument (not really an argument)
Is that data is a field for those that are naturally curious which is false another false statement is saying that it's also for those that believe in continuous learning also false

My point is these traits can be attributed to anyone in any field
6/16/22, 7:21 PM - S+N Ayoade: Hello house, 

please I need resources for a virtual Assistance role.

Thank you
6/16/22, 7:21 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Alex the analyst...🤣
6/16/22, 7:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Obviously which is 💯 true. 

The conversation flow which I believe the post shared speak to is the fact that to *do well* in tech generally you need to have knack for *continuously learning* not necessary curiosity because  that can be learnt. 

So, yeah you are 💯 correct with no contradiction that the skill is valid and needed across profession.
6/16/22, 7:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Which one be virtual assistance again 🥶
6/16/22, 7:24 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Remote PA 🧐
6/16/22, 7:24 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Boss go do politics see as you end argument wey suppose dey interesting🌚🌝🤣🤣

6/16/22, 7:26 PM - +234 708 675 3621: But here's the thing you don't have to be curious or want continuous learning to be called a "data engineer" I know a lot of folks in banks that their jobs is to run pre written ETLs and they are called data engineers, can we say that they are curious and want continuous learning when they have basically turned the data role into a monotonous one
6/16/22, 7:27 PM - +234 708 675 3621: With more advancement in tech the skill levels drop significantly

6/16/22, 7:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Thinking through your perspective again which is valid, I think it also depend on individual too. 

Someone like me would be bored and tired of it. The moment I get to an apex of learning where I feel nothing challenging again or no new learning and I can literally deliver the job without any prep or anything , then frustration start setting in. 

Another person make like it that way, no stress 😎. So yeah your angle is very valid about continuous learning been relative even in the space itself and doesn’t make that person inferior or less fulfilled

Dax is just like excel functions and formulas.

However the new feature in Powerbi allows for writing and running your sql queries(Powerbi Datamart).
6/17/22, 6:41 AM - +234 806 593 5396: This your question is suspicious 🤔 

Very soon you will say Power BI is a programming language 😀

6/17/22, 8:11 AM - +234 818 047 2075: You probably can but it may be more stressful especially because PowerBi doesn't come with some charts pre-installed e.g. box plots, pair plots etc. You have to use the store. I also think Seaborn or matplotlib will give you some more flexibility.
6/17/22, 8:13 AM - +234 703 806 5681: It's more an issue of you not framing your question properly, than the reader's comprehension.

6/17/22, 8:22 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yes, you can there's a library that allows you import a dashboard.

6/17/22, 8:23 AM - +234 708 145 1890: He wants to do his EDA using Power BI and put his dashboard in a jupyter notebook.

Then continue his model writing python.
6/17/22, 8:24 AM - +234 806 593 5396: Can he escape coding?

6/17/22, 8:24 AM - +234 708 145 1890: The thing is just that all your manipulations in Power BI I don't know how you want to export the clean data from Power BI to use in your notebook for your model.

6/17/22, 8:25 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Shouldn't there be something that handles this?

Or save the file and import into whatever you guys use to write Python.
6/17/22, 8:28 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Alright, thank you
6/17/22, 8:28 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Yes, I want to code. However, I use to forget codes. 😂😂😂
6/17/22, 8:29 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I think what I will do. Thank you all
6/17/22, 8:30 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea. It's possible.

If he has his data in Power BI service, he can export the cleaned data.

6/17/22, 9:47 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Guys, help me understand something please.

There are people who are positively upset when someone posts a "win" online or talks about getting something like a visa, etc.

I'm really trying to understand why anyone would think these things are unnecessary.

Here's an example:

A friend of mine read my ICAN story on LinkedIn once and told me months later that she felt that post was unnecessary. And it felt like I was boasting.

Someone else says he's disgusted when people come to church to testify about receiving a visa.

Another person is angry that BBN housemates get endorsement deals and fan gifts.


I'm confused about all these ill feeling towards someone's good.

If there a perspective I'm missing here?

6/17/22, 9:48 AM - S+N Ayoade: 😂
6/17/22, 9:48 AM - +234 703 954 3297: You're not missing anything 
Some people don't know how to celebrate with others
6/17/22, 9:49 AM - S+N Ayoade: People project their insecurities to others.

I’m always happy for every little wins because I know what it might have take to get the result the person is celebrating!
6/17/22, 9:49 AM - S+N Ayoade: I take this as permission granted !

Thank you sir
6/17/22, 9:49 AM - +234 810 878 6913: One thing you should understand is that people's perspectives are different. 

I believe it's an act of jealousy. They get easily angered when others achieve what they're unable to achieved
6/17/22, 9:50 AM - +234 806 593 5396: People with such mentality are bad belle, please remember them in your prayers....

I mean, you don’t know how long it took me to get it done 🤦🏽‍♂️
6/17/22, 9:52 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Buju sang the song already

*Its so COLD OUTSIDE* ☹️
6/17/22, 9:52 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Two things come to mind:
* Some wins bring to fore some peoples insecurities and disappointments. This is their problem not yours. They need to work on it. You should be happy for other people.
* The second is that some people are private people and would rather just keep things to themselves and away from public eye. In this case wins are shared with intimate parties. Again I don't think they should project their preferences on others.
6/17/22, 9:52 AM - +234 818 415 3106: So their are people that are not happy cus someone is winning
6/17/22, 9:52 AM - +234 818 415 3106: God is the greatest
6/17/22, 9:52 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Exactly. 

You are 💯 correct with the 2nd because I have someone who buzzed me on something I shared. I was like baba that’s you not me
6/17/22, 9:52 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Except the win is something intimate, I don't see why it should be kept secret.
6/17/22, 9:53 AM - +234 818 047 2075: *they should be happy for other people
6/17/22, 9:53 AM - +234 806 593 5396: @2348108522573 remember how we aggressively celebrate people's success here to the extent that we even appoint GoodNews Officer 😁 The motive behind this idea is to help everyone stay motivated.

6/17/22, 9:55 AM - +234 706 439 6712: This message was deleted
6/17/22, 9:55 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Same way people learn and are encouraged when you share your wins and stories. 💯💯
6/17/22, 9:55 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Thanks for the second point. That gives some perspective to the issue.

And you're correct in saying we shouldn't project our preferences on other people.

Even the Bible wants us to testify of God's goodness. Unless we believe what we have received didn't come from him.

I've also learned that acknowledging a good thing and telling others about it give them hope. And hope keeps a lot of people sane and motivated to keep trying and waiting for their own miracles.
6/17/22, 9:55 AM - +234 818 415 3106: @2348065935396 knows me to an extent, i no dey send anyone as i dey

6/17/22, 9:58 AM - +234 818 415 3106: i no mind host you cus this one long oooo😂😂😂
6/17/22, 9:58 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Exactly. Testimonies should help other people realise that God is good and is able to do good also for you.
6/17/22, 9:58 AM - +234 706 439 6712: _Its human nature ,especially Africans. Folks hate what they can't become, criticize what they wished  for but ain't getting, but someone is getting it._

_They feel it's luck or mere chance, forgetting that time and chance happens to everyone. Be happy and rejoice with others, as you put in the work, pray to your  God, and keep doing the right things you ought to ( especially helping others and keeping good networks). Your own time would come._  




P.S:Small minds always do that. Big minds don't have that time.
6/17/22, 9:59 AM - +234 806 593 5396: Some people are relying on your story to survive. Don't allow the mediocre to discourage you from doing the work of thy Lord....
6/17/22, 10:02 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I know right. 

Na moral booster
6/17/22, 10:02 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I started believing anything is possible when I heard my friends stories

6/17/22, 10:09 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Or did you guys not see the tweet from that Professor yesterday
6/17/22, 10:10 AM - S+N Ayoade: The 400k professor?

6/17/22, 10:10 AM - S+N Ayoade: It’s crazy honestly
6/17/22, 10:10 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Education sector in Nigeria is just sad.
6/17/22, 10:10 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I was like, now I see why one of my proud friend then would say he could pay our HOD his salary for 6 months ahead and not feel it

6/17/22, 10:11 AM - S+N Ayoade: 6 month ahead 😂
6/17/22, 10:11 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly d point...


Reason why I posted it here.
6/17/22, 10:11 AM - +234 816 484 7452: For context a professor has at least 20 years of experience ooo and the highest degrees
6/17/22, 10:11 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Folks tinz ur wasting time. Upskilling in Data and tech...
6/17/22, 10:12 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Until u get a hit Job... Which pays X50 of their 5 years salary in a month.. Dey begin to wonder...
6/17/22, 10:12 AM - S+N Ayoade: I mean what people make in hours is what someone makes in a month and some people are hating because you’re sharing good news ?


Imagine the first person to use tech in Nigeria didn’t share the good news 😂 

All of us for be electrician like @2348108522573
6/17/22, 10:14 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Strange Bullet hit person
6/17/22, 10:14 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The reality though is that everyone won’t do Tech. 

We still need other professions to survive
6/17/22, 10:14 AM - +234 703 806 5681: 😂😂
6/17/22, 10:14 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂😂🤣

6/17/22, 10:15 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Haaaa

I dey my lane stray bullet come meet me
6/17/22, 10:15 AM - +234 703 806 5681: The important thing is for people to go where their strengths and joy lie and be happy.

Be content.
6/17/22, 10:15 AM - +234 814 669 0593: It is not just in the education sector or education sector in Nigeria. Worldwide, salary in education is not attractive relative to tech roles.  


The folks I was looking up to in the oil and gas sector regarding skills and finances.  Most have advanced degrees and years of experience; I believe I earn more than most of them now with a few years in tech.
6/17/22, 10:15 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This is the summary in all honesty.
6/17/22, 10:15 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Leave him 🤣😂

6/17/22, 10:22 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That content is the koko 

We sha see Netflix engineer hitting $500k and resigned that he wasn’t fulfilled. 

Money may not be fulfillment for some. That Prof post really shocked me haaaaaa but many of them enjoy the job
6/17/22, 10:22 AM - S+N Ayoade: GNLD marketers will peal shyness from you 😂
6/17/22, 10:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s not as terrible the way it is here. 

A Prof in US still net $60-65k
6/17/22, 10:23 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I will rather secure the bag first before considering the academia
6/17/22, 10:23 AM - +234 814 669 0593: I will use the money to find fulfillment 💅🏿
6/17/22, 10:24 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Tech is the way...


But we all mustn't be in tech...

 But somehow, we all should find a way of affiliating and harmonizing our skills and background experiences into tech.


What's where the world is headed .😎
6/17/22, 10:25 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not same for everyone believe me. 

I didn’t consider Academia because I wanted the bag 💼. My HOD during my NYSC still wondering why I didn’t consider Academia because I taught so well and as 1st Class grad. Me wey dey find money 😂😂
6/17/22, 10:25 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I don do the permutation see say omooo na to enter hustle street learn Tech forget Elect
6/17/22, 10:26 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You no like Academia na. 

I have folks that really love it than something else. So just as @2347038065681 said, find what make you happy and stay with it.
6/17/22, 10:27 AM - +234 708 145 1890: My Undergraduate Paper got published last month.

6/17/22, 10:28 AM - +234 814 669 0593: I like academia , I like research, I find fulfilment in teaching.  I plan to do so in the future but for now, it will remain a side gig 😁

6/17/22, 10:30 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Please let's remove this "especially Africans" mindset 🙏🏽
6/17/22, 10:30 AM - +234 708 145 1890: You get it...

In a way, most of us actually like to impart and transfer knowledge. Like to get new ways to do things.

But omoooo.... 😂

Later things.
6/17/22, 10:33 AM - +234 706 439 6712: That's the truth , sir.

I might be wrong though .
6/17/22, 10:36 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/17/22, 10:38 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Runaway from Envying People, when you know them it's good you block them. 

Celebrating success is a bliss
6/17/22, 10:38 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Truth that might be wrong? Should I call it a conjecture or supposition?
6/17/22, 10:39 AM - +234 803 353 6901: I read and Islamic view on this matter this morning
6/17/22, 10:41 AM - +234 803 353 6901: It's a about Joseph and his brothers, when he told his father Jacob about his dream. 

Jacob said don't allow your brothers know about this.
6/17/22, 10:41 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Imagine, *his brothers* shouldn't be aware of successful he is going to be
6/17/22, 10:41 AM - +234 803 353 6901: A matter that was meant to happen
6/17/22, 10:42 AM - +234 706 942 4890: na jus jealousy
6/17/22, 10:42 AM - +234 803 353 6901: They heard about it and still plotted the evil

6/17/22, 10:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You people don’t want to chase passion
6/17/22, 10:43 AM - +234 806 593 5396: Dream is different from reality sir
6/17/22, 10:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na money una dey chase
6/17/22, 10:43 AM - +234 703 316 7142: We should not be painting ourselves black by judging just by the behavior of some samples around us. 

We are all humans irrespective of the color, our mentality may differ cos of our environment but that doesn't change who we are, it's just perspectives.
6/17/22, 10:45 AM - +234 806 593 5396: As if za Oyinbos too no get village people 😂

6/17/22, 10:48 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I think that when God gives us a dream, we should keep it to ourselves and wait the manifestation.

But I also believe irrespective of what the "enemy" does with our dreams and visions, God has control over everything in the known and unknown universe. He will work ALL things for our good.
6/17/22, 10:48 AM - +234 703 806 5681: We should live with wisdom everyday.

Good morning everyone,

I want to share this little work of mine with everyone. I will sincerely appreciate our feedback on it.

Thanks🙇🏾‍♂️
6/17/22, 11:04 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Danny Ma... I like that guy
6/17/22, 11:05 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Nice one 

You can use GitHub gist for your code snippet.
6/17/22, 11:06 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Ok sir🙇🏾‍♂️
6/17/22, 11:07 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Thanks a lot for the feedback
6/17/22, 11:08 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do you plan to have another article for how you solved each questions ?
6/17/22, 11:09 AM - +234 817 925 1327: Yes, it's coming up
6/17/22, 11:21 AM - +234 703 316 7142: You didn't use the empty cells for exclusions when treating the NULLs, you only considered for extras
6/17/22, 11:25 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Ian Goodfellow, the guy who invented generative adversarial networks in deep learning, did his PhD under Yeshua Bengio. He likely would have continued being a researcher in the university but after that discovery, companies like Google, DeepMind started bidding for him.

He got an offer of around $1m; that's like 20 times what he could possibly hope to start off with had he stayed in academia. The guy just left Apple recently (he is the Apple director you probably heard of in the news that left Apple for not wanting to go back to office).

Academia generally has never been very deliberate about rewarding talents. In fact, these days, you find a lot of science professors holding positions in Big tech or private research companies.
6/17/22, 11:25 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Lol, I bet you the academic work sef is the side hustle 😂
6/17/22, 11:26 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Yeah, that's way better than in Nigeria here. But when you think of the number of years folks put in before earning $60k as a professor, chai!

If you put in all those years and efforts in tech, na Director or Senior leadership status na 😩. We are talking 20x to 50x here 🤦🏽‍♂️
6/17/22, 11:26 AM - +234 904 894 6475: My professors till this day are amazed I didn't consider academia. They so believed I was a professor in the making, and e remain small, me sef for dey believe that thing 🤣

Although very soon, we might have to “clean” the group so there can be more space for active people.

6/17/22, 10:08 PM - Chinwe O: Depending on the type of Max

We can’t use a chatbot on here so we’d probably have to use a google doc or something.

6/17/22, 10:10 PM - Chinwe O: 😂
6/17/22, 10:10 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Parallel is a paid tool

6/17/22, 10:11 PM - Chinwe O: Yes it is but you can be refreshing the trial period if you want you resetting your date
6/17/22, 10:11 PM - Chinwe O: Best you go with Bootcamp
6/17/22, 10:12 PM - Chinwe O: You can’t use Bootcamp with M1 MacBook. It’s not supported

6/17/22, 11:45 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The way that data changed (birth year dropped after 2018 and postal code added) can be very dangerous for a machine learning model in production if there's no close monitoring. This is just one example of data drift and can trigger serious antipatterns and technical debt. Very terrible nightmare 💀
6/17/22, 11:45 PM - S+N Ayoade: Wonder why they changed information though

6/19/22, 11:15 AM - +234 701 047 4062: Hello good morning 😊 
I have a problem working with aws lambda function

I have connected my lambda function to github with code build and everything seems fine with the codebuild and deployment however I have multiple python files in my project. 
So I tried importing functions from my other scripts from the lambda_function script

 ```from script import my_func``` 

 but it throw error say 
"No module named: script" 

My working directory is something like this

project directory
				lambda_function.py
				script.py

It works fine on my system but on aws when testing the lambda_function it brings that error.

Any help will be appreciated please 🥹🥹
6/19/22, 11:22 AM - +234 909 130 5248: How about adding an init file??
6/19/22, 11:31 AM - +234 701 047 4062: You mean I should add
___init___.py to the folder?

I read on stack overflow that I should keep all my dependency scripts in a folder that contains ___init___.py

Something like this

project directory
			lambda_function.py
			utility_folder
						___init___.py
						script.py



But it still didn't work
6/19/22, 11:31 AM - +234 909 130 5248: No, put the lambda function in the folder
6/19/22, 12:11 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Assuming your parent directory is src
1. Try importing with src.path.to.function

Like
 from src.script import *

If it doesn't work or you receive no module named _src_ 

2. Try adding the parent directory to path.

Before the import line

Add

Import sys
Sys.path.append('path to parent directory')

6/20/22, 1:34 AM - S+N Ayoade: Good morning night Owls,

So I’ve been battling with this Covid data for a while now.

Apparently, the Repatriated Travellers ( a state in Canada) has no value in the longitude and latitude columns and it’s affecting plotting the data on a map.

I went back to power query to generate a new long and lat column for the entire data and set the value of any missing province for both long and lat to be 0.0 but it’s coming out as just 0 alone.

I’ve tried to use use “0.0” but that also is coming out with quote.

What’s the best way to get 0.0 for those rows missing long and lat values 🥺

Thank you

6/20/22, 2:42 AM - +234 909 431 5803: 0 and 0.0 is essentially the same thing.

You can change the number format on that column to show 1 decimal place if you want to see it as 0.0
6/20/22, 2:46 AM - S+N Ayoade: 1…

Will try when PC is alive.. 

He’s dead for now 😂
6/20/22, 4:22 AM - +234 907 510 4857: Change your data  type to decimal on your query
Currently it’s on text

Let me know when you do that
6/20/22, 6:23 AM - +234 812 178 9229: You can use find  and replace to remove the " "
6/20/22, 6:29 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Your lat and long datat type is in text change it to decimal
6/20/22, 6:36 AM - +234 703 047 1536: Good Morning oo,

You cannot treat lat and long values as normal numeric data where you can just fill empty columns with any number.


Every lat and long number you have in your data is referencing a place on the Earth including Lat 0.0 and Long 0.0

Lat 0.0 and Long 0.0 is a place on the earth which is not Canada. 


The best thing you have to do is check if the province exist and then look for the lat and long through research

6/20/22, 6:47 AM - +234 703 047 1536: In addition,


I would assume that if the data doesn't inlcude lat and lon for that place, the place is probably non-existent.

But I could be wrong.
6/20/22, 7:20 AM - +234 907 510 4857: Or make your 0 text
Put it in quotes make it 0.0
6/20/22, 7:21 AM - +234 907 510 4857: True

I have an issue please.

I am using a LookUp function, but I want to make the DataSource dynamic.

The DataSource in the LookUp function should be based off a Choices column in my SharePoint list.

My major issue is getting the datatype of the selected choice to be equal to the needed format for the LookUp DataSource argument.

The DataSource is a Collection created in App.OnStart.

Any help?

6/20/22, 2:11 PM - +234 813 882 2739: Wonderful
6/20/22, 2:11 PM - +234 813 882 2739: So that’s the issue I guess….
 Repatriated travellers isn’t a valid province in Canada… that’s why you don’t have long and lat for it
6/20/22, 2:12 PM - +234 813 882 2739: I’m not sure what the context on the data is . However, off the top of my head , if people were distributed across various provinces , others were probably sent back and tagged repatriated travellers
6/20/22, 2:13 PM - S+N Ayoade: It’s Covid data from John Hopkins University GitHub Repo
6/20/22, 2:13 PM - +234 703 047 1536: It's not a province.

I think repatriated travellers would mean those people that were not allowed to enter Canada or sent back during COVID period. It was very prevalent then.
6/20/22, 2:14 PM - +234 813 882 2739: I see …. So those people weren’t allowed or were returned to their country or wherever
6/20/22, 2:14 PM - +234 703 047 1536: Do you have lat/lon for each of the province
6/20/22, 2:14 PM - S+N Ayoade: Yes ..

Only the repi people didn’t have long and lat
6/20/22, 2:15 PM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
6/20/22, 2:17 PM - +234 703 047 1536: Last thing you can do as a final check is to research all the provinces in Canada - check from a reliable source, if Repi Traveller isn't included then discard it from your data. 


It
6/20/22, 2:18 PM - S+N Ayoade: How do I discard it directly from my query ?
6/20/22, 2:19 PM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
6/20/22, 2:26 PM - +234 703 047 1536: If you keep the lat/lon column empty, the tool should automatically ignore it when plotting.
6/20/22, 2:27 PM - +234 703 047 1536: It's hard to also advise since I don't know how the other column for repi traveller would affect your data.

Are there are any useful colum for repi traveller
6/20/22, 2:28 PM - S+N Ayoade: Recovered, Death and Comfirmed cases
6/20/22, 2:29 PM - +234 703 047 1536: Let's do a Whatsapp Call instead if you are open.

The end goal will determine the perfect Data cleaning to do in this instance.
6/20/22, 2:46 PM - S+N Ayoade: I want to plot this locations of the Covid cases on a map but one province has no value for long and lat.

After finding the culprit, it happened that na Canada dey send people back 😭😭

6/20/22, 2:50 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Hi everyone, please a friend needs a place to intern during NYSC here in Lagos. He's into software engineering. Any recommendation would be highly appreciated. 

Gracias!
6/20/22, 2:51 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Is the Data only for Canada or global?
6/20/22, 2:51 PM - S+N Ayoade: Global
6/20/22, 2:52 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And you have RT folks across different regions of different countries or this scenario is only specific to Canada?
6/20/22, 2:56 PM - S+N Ayoade: Only canada
6/20/22, 2:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What’s the cardinality for the confirmed field generally?

And what’s it for the RT Canada problematic data?
6/20/22, 3:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 2 approach 

1. Easiest option - remove that data.  My assumption is since it’s a global data the proportion should be infinitesimal given that it’s only specific to Canada, so not sure there’s any interesting insight you want to communicate. I may be wrong, you have more context to the data. 

2. If  you don’t want to exclude the data for any reason , I would look for a province (maybe the one close to the border 😂, research will help you here) not represented in the Canada region and use that Log/Lat. However, this will be communicated during presentation or report.

6/20/22, 3:11 PM - +234 703 047 1536: No 2 would be a totally wrong approach and not advisable
6/20/22, 3:17 PM - +234 703 047 1536: My option 2 would be.

Plot the data on the map correctly. Create a different visualization (text) to explain    the outlier (Repi Traveller)
6/20/22, 3:18 PM - +234 703 047 1536: The best option would be to remove the data since it doesnt represent any location on Earth and everything Ope said as Option 1.
6/20/22, 3:19 PM - S+N Ayoade: Looking at option 2, it’s very unlikely to know which province the RT people are from..

It could be from all the Province or few of the province
6/20/22, 3:22 PM - S+N Ayoade: I think this is what @2347030471536 also suggested.

To fully automate the process, I will have to do a macro stuff to be removing RT people every time the data is refreshed 🥺

There’s been a recent Data battle around MDS it’s not becoming a Us against them convo 😂. 

A school of thought believe MDS was sold as a marketing strategy between some companies and VCs (Amplify Partners they say and many others) and it was well positioned and bought well. This is the folks that believe MDS is just unbundling what has existed before. 

Another sets looking for how to eat the National cake of MDS by looking for available feature to build a startup on 😂. 

It’s really an interesting time in the space 😂
6/20/22, 6:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *It’s now becoming
6/20/22, 6:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No doubt MDS have a bottleneck join issue with the rise of various tools.  

Though I still believe the ROI of MDS is great for companies sha because it’s basically help them stand a Data infrastructure without heavy resource and technical capabilities, and no doubt there’s risk of increased technical debts if not properly done.
6/20/22, 6:34 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I don't think one can debate the value when you consider where things are coming from.

6/21/22, 10:29 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Learning purpose or production project?

In both instances it’s all your choice. Nothing like best left to me because they all have their strength and weakness. 

So go for any tool that fit your use case. Viz tool for reporting;

Power BI
Tableau
Google Data Studio
Quicksight 
Looker
Metabase
Lightdash

Etc.
6/21/22, 10:30 AM - S+N Ayoade: Na Nepa caused break in transmission 😂
6/21/22, 10:31 AM - +234 810 337 1133: I meant like a portfolio platform 

Where you can have all the Visualisation projects you have done
6/21/22, 10:32 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2349077393129 tweeted platforms you can leverage.
6/21/22, 10:34 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Tableau Public 😐
6/21/22, 10:36 AM - +234 810 337 1133: Okay 
Thank you 

I will check it out
6/21/22, 10:36 AM - +234 810 337 1133: Thank you @2347038065681
6/21/22, 10:37 AM - +234 708 145 1890: You can do a github page.

You might need some styling (HTML, CSS), but it's nothing you can't handle.
6/21/22, 10:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Or just fork what someone has
6/21/22, 10:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I found a great Github portfolio page a while back. Lemme see if I still have it.
6/21/22, 10:39 AM - +234 708 145 1890: nice!

Thank you @2347038065681
6/21/22, 10:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Alternatively, visit carrd.co website, sign up, pick the "portfolio" template and build it out. It's drag and drop and easy to use.

Then share that.
6/21/22, 10:39 AM - +234 810 337 1133: Okay
6/21/22, 10:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: If you want to pay for it, it's $19 per year.
6/21/22, 10:40 AM - +234 810 337 1133: HTML, CSS🌚🌚🌚
6/21/22, 10:41 AM - +234 810 337 1133: That would really help
6/21/22, 10:41 AM - +234 810 337 1133: Meanwhile,  I will check this one now

6/21/22, 10:44 AM - +234 703 806 5681: You have a Github account, right?

6/21/22, 10:48 AM - +234 810 337 1133: I have an idea on how to, I have joined a class on it but haven't tried it out
6/21/22, 10:50 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Not good enough.

You need to use a tutorial that you can "watch and do" together.
6/21/22, 10:54 AM - +234 810 337 1133: I found some beginner videos on YouTube 

Thank you

6/21/22, 4:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: People who use MTN Hynet router, what's the data plans like and does it last a full month for you?
6/21/22, 4:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Not sure what that expression means tbh
6/21/22, 5:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Not too hot and not cold
6/21/22, 5:00 PM - +234 816 484 7452: What do they now want ☹️
6/21/22, 5:00 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Asked. They mean they're unable to pay beyond the price range mentioned earlier
6/21/22, 5:01 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Okay cool
6/21/22, 5:01 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I do 10k 80gb seems to last more, and more reasonable than Airtel (at my side here).
6/21/22, 5:02 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 80g isn't shabby I guess.

It rolls over, right?

How do you recharge? Banking app?
6/21/22, 5:02 PM - +234 812 331 2626: 10k gives you 80gb?
6/21/22, 5:04 PM - +234 810 831 6393: PS: my router never reach 6 months sha.

But even my main sim (10+ years ) gives me double data most of the time. You might want to check for eligibility sha.
6/21/22, 5:04 PM - +234 703 806 5681: If anyone is interested, let me know.

It's for a whole day and may spill into a second day.
6/21/22, 5:04 PM - +234 812 331 2626: Wawu. I’ll check. Thank you
6/21/22, 5:05 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Kinda, what I do is renew my subscription on the last day of the month. Hence, my remaining data gets rolled over to the next month.
6/21/22, 5:07 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Did 80gb on the 1st of this month, still have about 20gb left. Will renew my sub either on the 29th or 30th of this month, so I can roll over to next month.

This man.
6/21/22, 5:45 PM - +234 816 484 7452: From the first 10 mins you would already know if you are talking to someone that has sense or not
6/21/22, 5:45 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And if they are ready to pay 70K 
Then I guess it is for a senior role

6/21/22, 5:48 PM - +234 904 894 6475: If you check that JD, you will realise it's a very senior role. They didn't even specify any tool or stack. 

Also, there's an interview panel. Which means they want to thoroughly exhaust every possible question to assess the candidate's capabilities set and suitability for the position.
6/21/22, 5:48 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And I don’t want money

So it will be like *who wants to be a millionaire*

You would hear something like

6/21/22, 5:51 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Cruise 😂🤣😂

6/21/22, 5:53 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Hi Candidate 

Over your 15 years of experience , can you briefly outline the steps with technical in depth of how you intend to take this Organization to a world class level of generating Value in data, putting in mind how we can tap into the wealth of intern and external streams of data for both batch and stream processing .

Na question wey go throw am off balance baba go collect
6/21/22, 5:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Be calming down 💀💀
6/21/22, 5:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What if the company still operate Excel files everywhere 😂
6/21/22, 5:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Oga Microsoft e calm down
6/21/22, 5:54 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Then as the person is talking , you would be dropping bullets or pot holes for the Ova
6/21/22, 5:54 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Oga 🤣😂
6/21/22, 5:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That level of experience will be more strategy kind of conversation
6/21/22, 5:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not really technical hands-on
6/21/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But they went to hire mercenary Interviewer
6/21/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly my point
6/21/22, 5:55 PM - +234 904 894 6475: They will just excuse you from the panel
6/21/22, 5:55 PM - +234 816 484 7452: How do you want to take us to the next level 🤣😂
6/21/22, 5:56 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
Na their money Dey go sha because they don hire mercenary 🤣😂
6/21/22, 5:56 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exactly 😂
The reason interviews like that take time is because it's very conversational, as opposed to fire brigade approach for much younger folks
6/21/22, 5:56 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 😂😂😂
6/21/22, 5:57 PM - +234 810 120 1520 left
6/21/22, 5:57 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes yes
6/21/22, 5:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But let’s ask ourselves this question

Is an Interview Panel worth it?

Do the Big Tech still do it?
6/21/22, 5:57 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: How many company operate at the Big Tech level for real??
6/21/22, 5:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Biko I said Big Tech ooooo and not startup or mid tier companies
6/21/22, 5:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: We shouldn’t be using Big Tech companies for major data decisions honestly. I hear this a lot from convos.
6/21/22, 5:58 PM - +234 816 484 7452: APC change
The change can start with them 😅
6/21/22, 6:00 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The Big Tech companies are like a minority in the scale of companies that want to be data-driven as such a different strategy,  infrastructure and team setup will be much optimal for others
6/21/22, 6:00 PM - +234 904 894 6475: But Big Tech does like 5 to 6 interview rounds so...
6/21/22, 6:01 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Hmmm...Kantar 🌚
6/21/22, 6:02 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Yeah. Moreover Big Tech hire for very narrow set of capabilities. You have very large teams, with each individual contributor doing just a small portion of the work.
6/21/22, 6:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly 
Which is better
6/21/22, 6:05 PM - +234 809 232 2950: <Media omitted>
6/21/22, 6:06 PM - +234 703 160 7868: I don't think the total years of experience has to entire be in data. Other areas relevant  to the role as well as experience in data should suffice.
6/21/22, 6:07 PM - +234 816 484 7452: True
6/21/22, 6:07 PM - +234 703 160 7868: This is very true.
6/21/22, 6:07 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I am actually just playing around here oo 😂🤣
6/21/22, 6:09 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But it is good that a company is thinking forward by getting the right set of people to conduct interview for them

6/21/22, 6:13 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I wouldn't say it is. There are really no absolutes when it comes to hiring frameworks. At the end, every company has to determine which framework works well for them. Many companies eventually figure it out after trying a lot of messy approaches.
6/21/22, 6:13 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🤣
6/21/22, 6:16 PM - +234 706 439 6712: My thoughts
6/21/22, 6:56 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Good evening everyone, 

What chart format is most suitable to utilize when making a call to action? Why?
6/21/22, 7:01 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnnn... I think it depends on the information and context you are presenting still.


This is cheaper compared to other plans, buy this plan - a bar chart of each plans

You are spending more on this food, get this food instead - donut can present this (if the foods are not more than 3 tho)

I stand corrected.

Research has shown that women are less likely than men to apply for this role if they do not have solid experience in 100% of these areas. Please know that this list is indicative and that we would still love to hear from you even if you feel you only are a 75% match. Skills can be learnt, diversity cannot.

6/22/22, 7:48 AM - +234 909 248 3462: I need ideas bosses...to the graduate in the house please how are you giving back or plan to give back
6/22/22, 8:02 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnnn...

Firstly, I volunteer, get involved in social impact organisations and events.

I think all you need to do is; is there a need around you? 
Can you fix it? If yes, go ahead and get started.
If no, what can you do about it.

Making awareness is part of giving back.

This WhatsApp group is a form of giving back by the Admins.

@2348120919501 runs a foundation for kids,
@2347038065681 does YouTube videos to teach us about Finance (very very helpful),
@2347033167142 does free SQL and R training from time to time.

Many times, giving back doesn't have to be big and loud, it's starts from the little things.

NYSC is a great avenue to give back.

The solution to that word count problem using pyspark Dataframe API  no reach 4 lines if you use method chaining.

6/22/22, 9:55 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Apparently some still use it
6/22/22, 9:55 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Despite so many alternatives on the market. From Hive to pig to Spark. Some humans/companies like complexity too much o 😅

Even Facebook had to build Hive with SQL interface to reduce MapReduce's complexity 😅
6/22/22, 9:56 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But come to think of it some organization entire stack might have been built with this tools as such migrating might be difficult
6/22/22, 9:57 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Great article
6/22/22, 9:57 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Cloud providers have different custom made tools to migrate Hadoop or map reduce environment

6/22/22, 10:10 AM - +234 803 353 6901: That's a general rate
6/22/22, 10:11 AM - +234 803 353 6901: There are some who sells it very high
6/22/22, 10:11 AM - +234 803 353 6901: The problem now is that the Tankers distributing the fuels are using Diesel

6/22/22, 10:13 AM - +234 803 353 6901: Most of them are not getting fuel to be distributed because they are not allowing them to increase the price of the Petrol
6/22/22, 10:44 AM - +234 810 831 6393: @2347033167142 boss, can you please (in short lines) explain this stuff theoretically, and not with code, please 🙏🥺
6/22/22, 10:54 AM - +234 703 316 7142: So for:

Mapper class - it takes the text file as input, trims each line and split by non alpha-numeric characters and then loops through each splitted words and assign 1 to each of them as key, value pair. Example: say words ['Hello', 'world', 'to', 'everyone'], you will have something like this:
Hello: 1
world: 1
to: 1
everyone: 1

Reducer class: it aggregates the key value pairs above grouped by each keys.

6/22/22, 12:45 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Great.
6/22/22, 12:45 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thank you.
6/22/22, 12:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: How about Mode?
6/22/22, 12:49 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Using RPA or selenium is also like using a browser to access it
6/22/22, 12:49 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But it is okay to go through the sites to see anything on Data privacy
6/22/22, 12:50 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But since they are Nigerian Sites, I really doubt they would have anything
6/22/22, 12:50 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea... I agree with this.

But I was talking about Mode (https://mode.com/) for a data playground.
6/22/22, 12:51 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Oh
Okay 👍
6/22/22, 12:51 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂

They should tho. In accordance to NDPR.

6/22/22, 1:53 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Web scraping isn't allowed on certain sites. You will need to check their site policies for this. Your portfolio shouldn't have scraped data from sites where it isn't allowed.
6/22/22, 1:54 PM - +234 818 415 3106: @2348183685814 how far make you use this one run change for your side apart from salary wey i dey pay you

6/22/22, 2:14 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I'm asking if it's allowed
6/22/22, 2:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I am not sure but I doubt, I will check the site policy

6/22/22, 3:36 PM - S+N Ayoade: Thanks 😊 

Will reach out
6/22/22, 3:37 PM - +234 708 145 1890: What's it boss?
6/22/22, 3:49 PM - +234 818 047 2075: my team wants to get visibility into the ETL process to avoid downstream issues with reports. So we need to create a log table that will contain the following columns: source table name, destination table name, source row count , destination row count, ETL status, Date. We will then have a power automate flow that looks at that table every morning and sends alerts to our MS Teams group chat. This way we will proactively catch issues before users do.
6/22/22, 3:53 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnnn... I guess the flow part is covered, the main thing is the log table.
6/22/22, 3:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: You can create your Log table in your db, and add steps that will update the table using SQL Query at each step of iteration.

I hope you have Power Automate Premium so you can connect with a db. If not, then maybe you should do SharePoint List.
6/22/22, 4:06 PM - +234 818 047 2075: The power automate part is sorted. It is the SSIS part that we need help. Do you have a sample data flow you have created or useful resources?
6/22/22, 4:09 PM - +234 706 057 7846: In fact, your power Automate flow doesn't have to wait till every morning. It can trigger the moment a new record lands on the table.

Now to the ETL process.
6/22/22, 4:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I figured SSIS should have a log for every ETL process that it runs.

I found this that saves SSIS logs to a database.

https://www.tutorialgateway.org/ssis-logging/
@2348180472075 does it suffice? @2347060577846 might have a different and more efficient approach.
6/22/22, 4:16 PM - +234 708 145 1890: https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/6334/create-custom-ssis-execution-log-part-1/

This is what I had in mind originally. an SSIS job that runs to update your log table with details if your ETL is completed.
6/22/22, 4:17 PM - +234 706 057 7846: @2347081451890 seems you took the link from my notebook 🤣🤣🤣. I have no other way for now. This is the same solution I wanted to recommend 🙂
6/22/22, 4:18 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Na you kuku teach me work😁🤗
6/22/22, 4:35 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I just checked, it doesn't. It doesn't have row counts for destination and source.
6/22/22, 4:37 PM - +234 903 783 8682: <Media omitted>
6/22/22, 4:38 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This looks promising. We will just add row count to it
6/22/22, 4:38 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks 🙏
6/22/22, 4:38 PM - +234 708 145 1890: You can add that manually.

By creating a job that will update the log table with the extra detail that you need.

Once the ETL process is done, the SSIS job will run and insert statement
6/22/22, 4:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly...

Just that this might be more stressful compared to the first. Which ever way boss.

😊
6/22/22, 4:39 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Oh I see. 👌
6/22/22, 4:40 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I think the first now makes sense. Since we can update the table
6/22/22, 4:40 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly what I think too.
6/22/22, 4:53 PM - +234 703 316 7142: There should be a way to fetch that from SSIS logs since it's part of what it reports when migrating the data.

How do I go about that

6/22/22, 5:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: dayColumn = DAY('table'[dateColumn])

That should do it.

Also check the linked devices on your WhatsApp to see how many devices are linked to your number. Normally it should be only your PC.. 'ideally'
6/22/22, 10:08 PM - +234 703 932 8188: Check App settings and list all apps including system apps. 

If you see a background process or app that is consuming power and data that you're not aware off. You might have been bugged

I no be outlier🤲🤲😢😢
6/23/22, 11:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I wished other platforms were intuitive and easily accessible like WhatsApp. 

We moved to telegram and activity dropped to almost 0%😅. We have a slack channel that just chilling.  I check in daily on slack because I’ve very active there because of other communities I’m in but nothing 😀. 

The only option now is to do constant pruning of the group to remove those that probably don’t need it group or inactive (metrics definition for inactivity is where the challenge will be but we will figure something out) to allow new entrants who may need it.
6/23/22, 11:24 AM - +234 905 939 2803: The metrics ehnnnnn
6/23/22, 11:24 AM - +234 909 248 3462: Just keep us informed boss we go do anything to pass metric test
6/23/22, 11:24 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Everyone dey learn, it's good if you contribute from time to time.

6/23/22, 11:25 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Maybe this may be a pet project for someone 😅😂, to develop an inactive fair metric model using the group’s data. 

What then will be defined as activity?  We will brainstorm when the time comes.
6/23/22, 11:25 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I am not even sure if Reactions are part of the Exported data.

6/23/22, 11:26 AM - +234 708 145 1890: How about reactions...

Even saying "Hmmmmm" counts 😂

6/23/22, 11:31 AM - +234 706 670 9874: What's the topic about?
6/23/22, 11:31 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Kilode
6/23/22, 11:31 AM - +234 905 939 2803: Fair across board hmmm this will be tasking
6/23/22, 11:31 AM - Mascot (Nafisat): Anything. 


As long as it’s valuable enough for people to pay .
6/23/22, 11:31 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah.

God go help us.
6/23/22, 11:32 AM - +234 818 047 2075: I think they are
6/23/22, 11:32 AM - +234 703 806 5681: My dear, work choke 😩

I barely write on LinkedIn too
6/23/22, 11:32 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, I noticed too.
6/23/22, 11:33 AM - +234 905 939 2803: When will I say sth like this🤔🤔
6/23/22, 11:33 AM - +234 703 806 5681: You want work to choke?
6/23/22, 11:34 AM - +234 905 939 2803: I sha need work. If it choke I'll start to complain
6/23/22, 11:35 AM - +234 703 806 5681: What kind of work?

6/23/22, 11:38 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Hahaha. I dey o.
6/23/22, 11:42 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Reactions should be a useful metric if everyone does it frequently. If you read and enjoyed what someone wrote, but cannot/don't want to contribute, you can as well react to it.
6/23/22, 11:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah yeah. 

I guess we can focus the analysis from the day reaction was launched to the date we will be doing the pruning.
6/23/22, 11:44 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly, instead of dropping your emoji as a message, drop a reaction.
6/23/22, 11:46 AM - +234 708 145 1890: That's fair.
6/23/22, 11:50 AM - +234 818 047 2075: You can also give people a week or 2 to change their inactive ways 😄 . Then do the analysis
6/23/22, 11:50 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 📌
6/23/22, 11:51 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Marketers here abeg I need some expert advice 

Anyone worked on Attribution model before?
6/23/22, 11:51 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2347033657422 @2348160427544 and others
6/23/22, 11:52 AM - Mascot (Nafisat): No, I’ve not
6/23/22, 11:53 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What influenced the choice of the attribution technique you adopt or choose? 

Or let me ask what’s the best attribution model you know from the past? I need a domain context to this to aid the analytics model I want to build.
6/23/22, 11:55 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Ok.
6/23/22, 11:58 AM - +234 706 499 0746: Sir, It's a AWS cloud data that segment customers based on their monthly spend, for example a customer whose monthly spend is like a million and above, they are categorized as A, those that spend 100,000 - 1 million they are categorized as B, 10,000 - 100,000 as C etc.

I don't know how best to get insight from that data.

Like getting an hypothesis from a past data like if we increase customer's category, it will lead to (possibly increase in revenue), trends that could help the business.

The end goal is to get actionable insight to  improve the service sir.
6/23/22, 12:07 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Is it only spend?
6/23/22, 12:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: On this for beginners and newbies in here. 

I understand that a couple of beginners and newbies may be overwhelmed by the information flow here. 

So next month, I plan to have an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session for all beginners and anyone interested. You can ask me any questions related to learning, career, and other things in your data journey. I'll be doing this once in a while.

More information to be communicated
6/23/22, 12:16 PM - +234 810 686 4060: Thanks boss
6/23/22, 12:23 PM - +234 705 764 1366: 😁❤️

6/23/22, 12:25 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Awesome initiative 👏. 📌 RT @2347046498585
6/23/22, 12:38 PM - +234 816 042 7544: Hi boss
6/23/22, 12:40 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hmmm i don't think you gave enough info for meaningful analysis. So for something like this, there are 2 ways I would go about it.
1. Get data over a period and  track if spend of certain customers is dropping. For customers who their value is dropping, I will check if they have given any negative feedback on our services or if there has been some downtime that has impacted them. Based on all that I can take specific actions. 
2. Check onboarding data for my clients. Check company size or use a proxy. Then compute an estimated expected spend for the customers and compare to what they are currently spending. Where the gap is high, we can get any additional info of how to increase the spend of those clients.
6/23/22, 12:40 PM - +234 818 047 2075: *have enough info for
6/23/22, 12:41 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Did something similar...tho no metric was defined..

Just load WhatsApp Chat Data in it and you'd get some info about the chats and users.
6/23/22, 12:52 PM - +234 704 649 8585: Yes💪
Thanks
6/23/22, 1:09 PM - +234 810 644 0791: Interesting.
Can you share his you did that?
6/23/22, 1:19 PM - +234 706 499 0746: Thank you sir for you input. 

Please can I send a DM?
6/23/22, 1:25 PM - +234 809 183 1446: This is one of the side project I do when the mood comes in 😅

If all conversations are banned here for instance, then we chose slack as the new headquarters.
6/23/22, 1:51 PM - +234 706 439 6712: PLS don't

6/23/22, 3:10 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Guys, please is a 15% default rate good enough for a lending company?
6/23/22, 3:11 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Personal loan or business?
6/23/22, 3:12 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Both.
6/23/22, 3:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It depends on what they want to optimize on for the credit risk model. 

Tagging all the bosses of credit risk @2348163815935 @2348167187102 @2348168847243 et. all
6/23/22, 3:13 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks boss. The goal is just to know if the company is doing well enough to be given money (loan)
6/23/22, 3:13 PM - +234 812 216 8133: To rephrase, would you give a lending company your money as a loan with a default rate of 15%?
6/23/22, 3:14 PM - +234 904 894 6475: There are no hard and fast rules, but 15% looks too high. What you should be interested in finding is the company's exposure at default for a given threshold.
6/23/22, 3:14 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Considering you need to make your money back + interest
6/23/22, 3:14 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Cool, 15% is too high..
6/23/22, 3:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Confirm the EAD in relation to whatever threshold you are defining
6/23/22, 3:16 PM - +234 812 216 8133: What's EAD?
6/23/22, 3:17 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Exposure at default
6/23/22, 3:18 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thanks boss.
6/23/22, 3:18 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Looks like loan sharks, to me. ( which I won't advice )


Loan interest rates should be as low as possible.. 

Flexible repayment spread.

Company credibility

And other important factors to consider b4 taking the loan..


Biko ur business should have strong turnover...



Other financial experts would add sha..
6/23/22, 3:19 PM - +234 904 894 6475: A good default rate should be somewhere between 1 - 2.5%. Anything above this might be a red flag.
6/23/22, 3:19 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Cool. Thanks boss
6/23/22, 3:22 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I don't know if @2347038065681 has something to say regarding this. I believe there will be standards for determining a reasonable risk threshold.
6/23/22, 3:24 PM - Abraham Musa: Hmmm.. @2349048946475 , do you have an idea of what default rates look like for an average naija company? 🤔🤔
6/23/22, 3:26 PM - Abraham Musa: Might be arguably but I think average NG lending companies have rates higher than that. Even few global companies struggle with 5 to 10%.
6/23/22, 3:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You want to lend money to a lending company?
6/23/22, 3:27 PM - Abraham Musa: The lending landscape in NG is very crazy to maintain low default rates.
6/23/22, 3:31 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I don't have that data, so I just gave a guesstimate based on international standards. But it seems it would be different here 🤔
6/23/22, 3:32 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I was initially surprised 😂
6/23/22, 3:33 PM - Abraham Musa: Sure. I know its certainly different here. I think maintaining a 10% in NG is a lot of effort. 🤣🤣🤣
6/23/22, 3:34 PM - Abraham Musa: I know a company in naija that has roughly 89% 😀😀😀😀🤣🤣🤣
6/23/22, 3:34 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Due to our "toxic economic atmosphere" , right ?
6/23/22, 3:35 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Den for just make am 100%...

🤥
6/23/22, 3:35 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Let the stealing be clear and obvious
6/23/22, 3:35 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. Toxic is understatement 🤣🤣🤣🤣.  Some people borrow loans even with the intentions of not paying back beforehand. People also game lending systems here and there.
6/23/22, 3:37 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 3:38 PM - Abraham Musa: People not even scared that by defaulting, lending companies reach out to all contacts on their phones.
6/23/22, 3:38 PM - Abraham Musa: I know how many strange messages I've gotten about people I don't even know. 

Please tell so so person to come and pay back else we'll do bla bla bla 🤣🤣🤣🤣😀😀😀
6/23/22, 3:39 PM - +234 703 954 3297: It's just to scare them
6/23/22, 3:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: From your experience @2348163815935 and knowledge of the toxicity in the environment, what safe rate do you leverage for your default rate for modeling purposes?
6/23/22, 3:42 PM - Abraham Musa: Can you clarify your question? Not sure I get the part from safe rate do you****
6/23/22, 3:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m just curious what’s the least default rate you work with even with your domain knowledge of various comrade for 9ja 😂
6/23/22, 3:48 PM - Abraham Musa: Oh... I think the least I can remember should be around 20ish for models I've built oo. But my former employer has something much better. I think around 10ish.
6/23/22, 3:49 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Most lending companies borrow to stay afloat o
6/23/22, 3:49 PM - +234 812 216 8133: The lender becomes the borrower
6/23/22, 3:51 PM - Abraham Musa: I'd say even that was achieved with so much efforts. They have many white guys building madass credit models. @2348145242333 is also one of their great engineers.
6/23/22, 3:53 PM - Abraham Musa: Even at that, I've met people who gave hints on how they outsmarted algorithms from lending companies but that's not a discussion here.
6/23/22, 3:57 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Apparently. I just saw this document from CBN on credit survey report for Q4 2020. It gets really high, here.
6/23/22, 3:57 PM - +234 904 894 6475: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 3:58 PM - +234 904 894 6475: See pages 3 and 6
6/23/22, 3:59 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 20% is scary o
6/23/22, 3:59 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Should be akin to corporate Bonds, right?
6/23/22, 3:59 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I can understand this then 😂
6/23/22, 4:01 PM - +234 814 524 2333: What you said about the average default rate for lending companies is very true @2348163815935. 
You can barely find any the rate below 15%.
6/23/22, 4:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 4:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I can imagine the dirty work done in the background by creditors to get their money from debtors when comrade don determine not to pay back 😂
6/23/22, 4:03 PM - +234 814 524 2333: One of the major problem here is that; most focus on assessing the propensity of an individual to pay back and do little to nothing around their ability to pay back.
6/23/22, 4:04 PM - +234 814 524 2333: To really drive the rate down, you need to be building/optimizing solutions to address this two topics.
6/23/22, 4:05 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 💯💯💯
6/23/22, 4:06 PM - +234 814 524 2333: Yeah, and this keeps messing up the space for the good guys.
They didn’t do their assignment well, then try using brute force to collect.
6/23/22, 4:08 PM - Abraham Musa: I just imagined one funny scenario. Imagine one humble broke guy trying to access loan but the ML model gave a FP prediction.  that's how they'll just go ahead and disburse. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6/23/22, 4:08 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Ope u funny..die 

🤣🤣
6/23/22, 4:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: True na 😂😂😂
6/23/22, 4:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Comrade don this money I no go return 😂😂
6/23/22, 4:08 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Comrade no get joy
6/23/22, 4:09 PM - +234 706 439 6712: 🤣

6/23/22, 4:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Mehn. 

It’s a crazy one and I believe you 💯 about optimizing for both factors because ability to pay mehnnn
6/23/22, 4:11 PM - +234 814 524 2333: Yeah, so they can brag about their loan book and how much they’ve disbursed or hoping that some kind of miracle will happen.
6/23/22, 4:11 PM - +234 814 524 2333: At all, some of these guys no get joy 😂😂
6/23/22, 4:12 PM - +234 812 216 8133: I don see where loan collector officer and debtor dey fight. E be like WW2😂
6/23/22, 4:15 PM - Abraham Musa: @2348145242333 do you know I once heard something. Loan collection agents in some lending companies go to mountain to pray so God can touch heart of defaulters to pay. Really crazy things man.
6/23/22, 4:20 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The heart of Kings is in the hand of God. 

Who you no fit catch you commit am to God. 

Comrade don say I won’t pay back 😂😂😂. Guuuy but people are funny in this 9ja sha
6/23/22, 4:27 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Bonds are given to the public to receive cash from them.
Ergo borrowing money to run the business.

6/23/22, 6:38 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
6/23/22, 6:38 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What are you trying to do?
6/23/22, 6:39 PM - Abraham Musa: First Task: I need to create views that automatically refreshes once the big query source table has new records. SQL code has to be written natively in looker.
6/23/22, 6:40 PM - Abraham Musa: Second Task: I need to create a lookML template that can be reusable for creating similar dashboards on future (slightly related tables).
6/23/22, 6:40 PM - Abraham Musa: Na here I dey for now. 🫤
6/23/22, 6:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Familiar with LookML?

6/23/22, 6:45 PM - +234 806 842 8052: I was asking because it’s not exactly best practice to build LookML dashboards or create derived tables in LookML.
6/23/22, 6:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯
6/23/22, 6:48 PM - +234 806 842 8052: Lookml dashboards are never dynamic. You might find a template in their documentation but since dashboards are not monolithic or in the same, consistent format, building a template for one dashboard may not be the best use of time.
6/23/22, 6:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Curious what’s the stack like that influence what you want to build?

Looker connected to Big-query? Yeah?
6/23/22, 6:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 🙌🙌🙌🙌
6/23/22, 6:51 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Since they don’t have dbt , I think he would have to write the LookML temporarily to create the needed explores, and also aware of the limitations that comes the creating PDTs for downstream usage
6/23/22, 6:51 PM - +234 806 842 8052: This is my guess. And since PDT is involved, maybe a heavy model that requires regular refresh based on timestamp.
6/23/22, 6:51 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. Bigquery to Looker.
6/23/22, 6:53 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. I'm told there's restriction to the native SQL you create within a single view. Also, for now you can read from BQ to looker but reverse not possible.
6/23/22, 6:54 PM - Abraham Musa: BTW, does BQ have some form of scheduling for SQL codes?
6/23/22, 6:54 PM - Abraham Musa: Is that what dbt does?🤔
6/23/22, 6:54 PM - +234 806 842 8052: @2348163815935 you can create derived tables and add the triggers that fit your objective. It could be time triggers. That’s literally what makes a PDT. You can reference the PDT in other views using {example.SQL_TABLE_NAME}
6/23/22, 6:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do that within Looker using triggers
6/23/22, 6:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Here @2348163815935
6/23/22, 6:56 PM - Abraham Musa: Okay. Thanks both. Any need I should be concerned about the first statement? I wonder how much of a processing capacity looker has backend. 🤔
6/23/22, 6:56 PM - Abraham Musa: Or is it best to break into subsequent derived views?🤔🤔
6/23/22, 6:57 PM - +234 806 842 8052: Naaa. Looker is good. The only think you might worry about is query run time
6/23/22, 6:57 PM - Abraham Musa: Yeah. Trying to run one colleague dashboard. Was very slow mehn.
6/23/22, 6:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can use looker to do it. The only challenge will be with build that with PDT which is why it’s best practice as @2348068428052 suggested to push some transformation upstream with a tool like dbt. So Looker only reference a transformed model view
6/23/22, 6:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *build time
6/23/22, 6:59 PM - +234 806 842 8052: That might be worse since you’re creating a PDT. You can make an incremental PDT so it doesn’t rebuild your table every time it runs. It can just add the new fields from BQ. This would reduce query run time. If you have an admin access, you can view your looker usage and query run times and use that view to adjust and optimize accordingly
6/23/22, 7:00 PM - Abraham Musa: Okay. Super useful details guys. Any thoughts on this?
6/23/22, 7:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s why I ask if you’ve written LookML before. 

You can check their docs if there’s a template you can leverage on, however it will be dependent on the metrics or what need to be created downstream which will influence how you write your LookML and necessary conditions you enforce.
6/23/22, 7:02 PM - +234 806 842 8052: I usually don’t subscribe to LookML dashboard 😂. But you can also create one dashboard and if you have data leaders in the department of your stakeholders, you can ask them to recreate from the one you’ve created. The whole point of using Looker is for data democratization. Let the stakeholders interact with the dashboards and make their own.
6/23/22, 7:04 PM - Abraham Musa: Alright. Thanks @2348108522573 and @2348068428052. Really appreciate.
6/23/22, 7:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So check out the following to give you more direction from Looker docs 

📌 PDTs 
📌 Incremental PDTs 
📌 triggers and how to set it 
📌 LookML and explores 

I believe you should have an idea of where to go from there leveraging on the downstream users.
6/23/22, 7:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Are you the one that want to consume the dashboard or you are creating it for stakeholders?
6/23/22, 7:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do they know how to use Looker explores at all?
6/23/22, 7:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: https://docs.looker.com
6/23/22, 7:11 PM - Abraham Musa: It's sort of mixed actually.  Once I'm done with my work, Data Scientist can track metrics on the model he/she built (I have all those logic defined, like sales rate etc), stakeholders can also play around with explores and build whatever kinda visualisation they like.
6/23/22, 7:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: God’s your strength 😂

6/24/22, 1:09 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Good Morning...
Please ASAP.

I urgently need the difference between

 ---IS NULL--- 

 and

 ----  = NULL--- 

In SQL
6/24/22, 1:10 AM - S+N Ayoade: How are you using the two ?

As filter or as value ?
6/24/22, 1:10 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: = 'NULL' mean the field is a string not the proper NULL data which will return empty if you filter by *IS NULL* command
6/24/22, 1:11 AM - S+N Ayoade: Exactly..

Why we need to know how the chief plans to use it
6/24/22, 1:11 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Filter...

I want to filter all NULL values in a Column
6/24/22, 1:12 AM - S+N Ayoade: Is null is what we work..

= NULL won’t work
6/24/22, 1:12 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can use both to check because some data aren't properly stored. Some will save NULL as string
6/24/22, 1:12 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Both can work depending on the data

= "NULL" maybe not =NULL literally
6/24/22, 1:12 AM - S+N Ayoade: IS NULL ✅ 
= NULL ❌
6/24/22, 1:15 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Oh ...ok...you mean purposely entering a NULL into a column I'll use = 

While for filtering emptys I'll use IS?
6/24/22, 1:15 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Ese SIR
6/24/22, 1:17 AM - +234 816 424 7582: One is a string while the other is literally empty Sir?
 Right?
6/24/22, 1:18 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For some data quality issues, it's possible to have data stored as a NULL literal (This is what the IS condition will work on) and NULL string (IS condition won't work on this because it's a string, so you filter like a string ="NULL"). Empty string can be filtered with =''
6/24/22, 1:19 AM - +234 706 439 6712: When u have entries that are named NULL in your table 

Den u can use = 'NULL' ..... ( string values ) 

but if ur solely interested in returning  'empty' cells or unknown values,  then use IS NULL  , that's how it's done.
6/24/22, 1:19 AM - +234 814 592 6677: IS NULL is ok and just as he said some field may look null but just blank space  and by that you won't be able to retrieve those ones as null 

I agree with IS NULL, but you could also check the entities if there are some looks null but blank space 
Thank you.
6/24/22, 1:19 AM - S+N Ayoade: “NULL” is already a value just like “Chibuike” while NULL is means it doesn’t have a value.

So if you filter by IS NULL, you’ll only get those rows that doesn’t have *values* but if your filter by = “NULL” it’s not different front when your filtering by = “Chibuike”
6/24/22, 1:20 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: IS NULL ✅
="NULL" ✅ (Possible for bad data quality)

IS "NULL" ❌
6/24/22, 1:21 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Ese Sir
6/24/22, 1:21 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What if you have empty cells replaced by empty string? 

IS NULL won't capture it o
6/24/22, 1:21 AM - +234 706 439 6712: We can as well have entries named 'None' 


If ur interested in returning such entries, it should be  = 'None'
6/24/22, 1:22 AM - +234 816 424 7582: This one is simple to grasp already!
6/24/22, 1:22 AM - +234 706 439 6712: That way why I put it in quote 


So he can understand easily...


Some empty looking cells are not actually empty
6/24/22, 1:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah, you are right. 

I'm saying from experience you can have both NULL and "NULL" and they look alike 😂😂
6/24/22, 1:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I've learnt it the hard way.
6/24/22, 1:23 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Thanks for using my Name 🤣🤣....it really sank in!!!
6/24/22, 1:24 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Empty string?
6/24/22, 1:24 AM - +234 816 424 7582: More light Pls?
6/24/22, 1:25 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Thanks a lot ...@2347064396712
6/24/22, 1:25 AM - +234 706 439 6712: I tried my best possible, not to use the word 'empty ' when explaining thanks values, in SQL / Databases.
6/24/22, 1:26 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Cuz empty looking cells are not always empty @2348164247582.. Take note
6/24/22, 1:26 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Oh! You mean "Empty" and literal empty as in No entry?
6/24/22, 1:28 AM - +234 706 439 6712: B4 u talk say Null na empty 


 *NULL IS NOT SAME AS EMPTY* in databases(sql) 



It might be in mathematics n normal algebra....

But databases has their way of interpreting tinz
6/24/22, 1:28 AM - +234 816 424 7582: 🖊️📒...noted!

6/24/22, 1:29 AM - S+N Ayoade: Omoo, NULL be like Nigeria Politics o.
6/24/22, 1:31 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Please naw let's stick to SQL 🤣🤣🤣🤣...

the Null Lecture will totally drift off with this comment already...

🤣🤣🤣.....
6/24/22, 1:33 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah. Empty strings 

Something like this 

'  ' 


Is a am an empty string.


Nothing will show but SQL sees it as something..including the spaces..

It would in fact count the characters
6/24/22, 1:34 AM - +234 706 439 6712: *null
6/24/22, 1:34 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Personally when I'm doing a null check or any cleaning, I check for NULL, "NULL" and '' in case of bad data from the source. So they are treated well. 

For NULL -   IS NULL or IS NOT NULL can be applied

"NULL" & '' - equality works for both like your name filter. 

I hope that helps

@2348164247582
6/24/22, 1:34 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah. 

Well articulated
6/24/22, 1:35 AM - +234 816 424 7582: 100% ....Ese PLENTY Sir

6/24/22, 1:36 AM - S+N Ayoade: This empty too are very dangerous mhen 😂 

Imagine having to be doing all sort of checking, IS NULL, = “NULL”, =“” 

🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
6/24/22, 1:36 AM - +234 813 819 8623: Omooo, small NULL that @2348183685814 taught me is what bosses are deliberating on for couple of minutes. 

I read through all comments. Thank y'all for the contribution🙌. Quite educative💯
6/24/22, 1:37 AM - +234 816 424 7582: I have a second question but Im still trying to articulate my words (please ooo! nothing to do with Atiku Trust Me🫠) ....
6/24/22, 1:38 AM - +234 816 424 7582: The last one is the  most wicked!  It never occurred to me at all!
6/24/22, 1:40 AM - +234 706 439 6712: 🤣...u call null small  abi? 


If ur not careful with null  filtering, it can  lead to serious business problems..  This is why in all ur mastery, master nulls 

"Null handling is crucial " for data cleaning.
6/24/22, 1:41 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: NULL & Dups are demon

I want to count the Number of NULL as seen and the ones With valid data bother under same column.

And then at the same Time Match them With their respective totals from another column....
6/24/22, 1:46 AM - +234 816 424 7582: I don't think I'm clear enough....

6/24/22, 1:58 AM - +234 816 424 7582: Ok...so There's a column called Second_language.

This Column contains NULL (as in the Proper null not the string nor the " " kind) and some valid fields.

I want a result that would;

1) count the nulls and The not nulls under the same column.

2) match them to their respective sums from another column .....

6/24/22, 2:12 AM - +234 816 424 7582: The columns Exist yes
6/24/22, 2:14 AM - +234 816 424 7582: I just want to know the sum of the donated amounts of both the null and The not null
6/24/22, 2:14 AM - +234 706 439 6712: So basically everything we need is in one table or we would need  to join another table, containing other information we would need ?
6/24/22, 2:16 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Do u have the schema for this database? 

It would help, as I get see the fields / table u posted, clearly
6/24/22, 2:16 AM - +234 706 439 6712: *cant
6/24/22, 2:17 AM - +234 816 424 7582: They'll need to be Joined...done that already.
6/24/22, 2:25 AM - +234 816 424 7582: I'll have sort out how to get the schema later Today.

6/24/22, 9:50 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I think you should shoot your question(s) here
6/24/22, 10:04 AM - +234 810 686 4060: Hello guys. Please I need any help or advice on a Python project.

I have this Python code that receives data from a spreadsheet, performs some tasks and returns an output.

But I now need the Python code to automatically run based on a trigger (which I'd soon talk about). So I'm thinking hosting the code on the cloud will be a good option since the trigger can happen at any time and my local machine is not always turned on to run the code. 

Now the trigger for the code to run is when a new entry enters the Google Sheet. The entry comes from a form online. So when a person fills the form, the Google Sheet is updated with a new entry (or row) and I want that activity to trigger the Python code to automatically run using that new data.

I have the Python code that does this offline. But of course, I have to manually run the code and be awake always to monitor the Google Spreadsheet which is impossible. I'd want the entire process to be run in real-time now without any human intervention. 

I'd appreciate advice from anyone. Would be nice if you have done something similar.
6/24/22, 10:07 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... If you have Power Automate, you can do this quite easily.
6/24/22, 10:08 AM - +234 809 183 1446: The Links Extractor project for YDP is something similar but it runs at the beginning of every month.

We used GitHub actions to automate the process.
6/24/22, 10:08 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Source : Google sheet 

Destination ??
6/24/22, 10:08 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Microsoft people 😂

You don’t know the destination yet na
6/24/22, 10:10 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Power automate is your sure bet
6/24/22, 10:10 AM - +234 816 484 7452: We don’t need to know the designation now 🤣

Where’s the Destination??
6/24/22, 10:11 AM - Joe: What kind of output
6/24/22, 10:11 AM - +234 816 484 7452: E no dey hook anything
6/24/22, 10:12 AM - Joe: I'd say appscript (you'd have to write JavaScript Sha). There an onchange something there
6/24/22, 10:12 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Was actually going to say this 👆
6/24/22, 10:13 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Cloud premise she’s interested in as well as what the output she want will determine an easy option.
6/24/22, 10:13 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yes ooo... over 100 connectors.

If we no get, we go build custom one 🌚
6/24/22, 10:14 AM - +234 816 484 7452: They don’t know what’s going on
6/24/22, 10:14 AM - Joe: You'll embed it in the Google sheets
6/24/22, 10:14 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Thats true.... google sheet uses JS in place of macros.

Why arent you doung Excel self 🌚
6/24/22, 10:15 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Opoooor
6/24/22, 10:15 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Interesting. 

Just hearing this.
6/24/22, 10:15 AM - +234 810 686 4060: Or no, let's say we'd update to the same Google Sheet

The final destination is still the same Google Spreadsheet. A new column will be created that holds the code output
6/24/22, 10:18 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnnn...

I think JS would be a very good option.

The entire code block would be in the same environment (your GoogleSheet).
6/24/22, 10:18 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Omo.... See how Microsoft 365 solves this problem under 30minutes.

Assuming your company uses Microsoft 365.

MS Forms for the Form
Power Automate for trigger and actions.

Shikena 🤩
6/24/22, 10:19 AM - +234 810 686 4060: The code output is a URL by the way
6/24/22, 10:20 AM - +234 810 686 4060: Hmmmm

6/24/22, 10:21 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Whatever the code output is, I believe you can run it with Power Automate.

After years of doing almost the impossible with Power Automate, my conclusion is, there's always a way with Power Automate
6/24/22, 10:22 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Always... last last, it might not be straightforward, but there is always.
6/24/22, 10:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What if the user isn’t locked in on Microsoft premise ? 😔
6/24/22, 10:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Still possible to extend Power Automate as a tool that can be extended an used?
6/24/22, 10:24 AM - +234 814 669 0593: 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁

6/24/22, 10:24 AM - +234 708 145 1890: If you don't have any special prefernece for google sheets.

Please make things easier with Power Automate.

6/24/22, 10:26 AM - +234 810 686 4060: Okay boss
6/24/22, 10:26 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So it’s a public service and accessible??
6/24/22, 10:26 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Yes. Every API is a connector in Power Automate.

I built Azure cognitive service API to run some task for me.

Turned it to a Connector in Power Automate and used it in my solution
6/24/22, 10:26 AM - +234 810 686 4060: Hmmm

Okay boss

6/24/22, 10:27 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I meant can I still have access to it even if I’m not using any Microsoft license or on an different platform but I think Power Automate will be a perfect easy fix for my task?
6/24/22, 10:27 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I was blown when i used *Microsoft Graph,* thats when I understood that every connector is an API.
6/24/22, 10:27 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m just thinking areas it will come handy
6/24/22, 10:27 AM - +234 708 145 1890: 🫣
6/24/22, 10:28 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *a
6/24/22, 11:04 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Power automate would have been your best bet like @2347081451890 and @2347060577846 siad. However, it has license implications. If it is hosted on a windows server, you can try task scheduler. It can run every 1 or 5 minutes. I think you need to save the python script as a batch file .bat. if it is a Linux server,  I think you need to use cron. Hope this helps
6/24/22, 11:05 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Asinh eh🤣🤣

6/24/22, 11:27 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I considered this option too, but She wanted google sheets online. The trigger to run the python script is if there is new row in the google sheet.

I also believe the task can be done entirely in Google sheets. Using .JS in scripts editor.

Another interesting thing is there might be custom apps that do what she wants in Google sheet. You can check the google sheets apps.

But if it's not a must to use google sheet, & you have a MS license; Power Automate is the way to go.

This will help if you want to build using Apps Script.
6/24/22, 11:31 AM - +234 818 047 2075: There is probably a python connector to Google sheet online. She can use that to constantly check the data for new rows. Using very closely spaced shedules e.g 1minute or 5 minutes will be close enough to new row trigger. Except she wants something real time
6/24/22, 11:33 AM - +234 818 047 2075: The challenge i have with .JS is the time it may take for someone who doesn't have experience in it. So if it needs to be quick and less cumbersome, I think task scheduler may help.
6/24/22, 11:41 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I am trying to think of how this will work.

The task scheduler will run the the python script every 1min (just saying this).

The python script will connect to the google sheet, check if there's a new record and update accordingly.

That's the flow right? 

This actually makes sense. 

There are googlesheets modules in python, but she will need to create a googlesheet API using google developer console.

6/24/22, 11:43 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Why could be wrong?
6/24/22, 11:43 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Power BI OGs make una help me 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
6/24/22, 11:43 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Do you have the right relationship between your tables?
6/24/22, 11:43 AM - +234 810 878 6913: You mean in my modeling?
6/24/22, 11:44 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Yeah
6/24/22, 11:44 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Is Age group a numeric column?
6/24/22, 11:44 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes exactly that is how it will work. She just needs to get an API key from console or she may be able to do basic authentication using username and password
6/24/22, 11:45 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Then the aggregate functions, I think you should consider *COUNTX* over ordinary *COUNT* and the likes. It helps you drill down on your data easily.
6/24/22, 11:45 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Data type is also an important factor to consider
6/24/22, 11:46 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Yea
6/24/22, 11:46 AM - +234 810 878 6913: No.
6/24/22, 11:46 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I'm not a Power BI OG sha, haven't used it for a serious task since the beginning of the year.
6/24/22, 11:46 AM - +234 810 878 6913: How can I create a relationship?
6/24/22, 11:47 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I am wondering how this is.

Is it possible to get a snapshot of your data?
6/24/22, 11:47 AM - +234 813 151 7157: Are you counting elements within each age group or its the age group itself you're aggregating?

If you're counting elements (people) in the age group distributed across departments, then the age group should be on the X axis, clustered by department whilst your Y axis bears the element (people) you're counting.

Check if this is your scenario.
6/24/22, 11:47 AM - +234 818 047 2075: They are 2 categorical columns. You can either use a two way table or a stacked column chart. Tbh not sure how best to achieve in Powerbi, you may need some visuals from the store.
6/24/22, 11:48 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Go to the modelling pane (if it's the right word to use) by the left side of your screen, you can see the respective tables, then you can  establish relationships between the tables.
6/24/22, 11:48 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Cc @2348108786913
6/24/22, 11:50 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly,thats why i asked what datatype is the age group.

He can do

Y axis = count of Age group
Legend = Age group
6/24/22, 11:52 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Done that
6/24/22, 11:52 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I want it the other way round
6/24/22, 11:54 AM - +234 810 878 6913: <Media omitted>
6/24/22, 11:54 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Alright, let me try this
6/24/22, 11:55 AM - +234 810 831 6393: Drag the needed attribute into the desired axis. This should be easy
6/24/22, 11:58 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I have done that, but it's the age group count that's showing
6/24/22, 11:59 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I want the age group to be like 10-20, 21-30, on the X-axis
6/24/22, 12:02 PM - +234 810 878 6913: <Media omitted>
6/24/22, 12:03 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Do you have an age group column already?
6/24/22, 12:04 PM - +234 708 145 1890: On the X? Or Y axis?

Y axis has to be numeric, or else you need to be plotting another type of chart.
6/24/22, 12:05 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Then switch the values.
6/24/22, 12:11 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes this should work 💯. Totally forgot about Legends. 

Chart option will look like this
Axis = Department
Legend = Age group
Value = Count of employees or people
6/24/22, 12:14 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Yea
6/24/22, 12:17 PM - +234 810 878 6913: The X-axis will be the department, how about the Y?
6/24/22, 12:34 PM - +234 818 047 2075: for Stacked column chart, the above I provided are the options you need.
6/24/22, 12:34 PM - +234 818 047 2075: <Media omitted>
6/24/22, 12:36 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Just to mention @2348108786913, age group is not numeric, its an ordinal (I.e. categorical but can still be ordered).

🙏🏾
6/24/22, 12:55 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay. How can I make it ordered
6/24/22, 12:55 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you
6/24/22, 1:13 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... I am not sure if this is necessary, but there's sort on column on the Table view of Power BI.

Maybe I am doing oversabi. I just mention the datatype for you to take note bro. 🙏🏾

6/25/22, 10:01 AM - +234 813 490 5672: Hi guys,

I require assistance with an sql query.
So I have a table that has a date attribute. I want to add an extra column that will have the maximum date available for the month where the date attribute falls.

Example:
Say I have 2022-02-08(Y-m-d) in a row, and the max date available for February 2022 on the table is 15th, my max date should be 2022-02-15

Note: it is maximum date available within the month the date entry falls, not in the whole table

Is there an easier and faster way to achieve this?🙏🏽

For people that have used/uses ADF (data factory with Data Flow) for tasks. How is/was the cost? 

I'd like to read reviews on it. I've used it a little, I like it but the thing dey fear me 

2) is there any difference between when one uses SDKs (or what is it called) against bindings (vice versa) in functions.
6/25/22, 11:19 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Yes. It has all the learning path for DP-100
6/25/22, 11:21 AM - +234 708 145 1890: How it take dey fear your? What are your fears if I may ask?
6/25/22, 11:25 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you so much for this. 
Will I be given a free voucher for the exam after the challenge?
6/25/22, 11:26 AM - Joe: In terms of cost
6/25/22, 11:30 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I saw this coming 😂
6/25/22, 11:34 AM - +234 706 057 7846: 🤣🤣🤣.

So, the voucher available now is for Fundamental Exams. But for Associates, you can watch out for some cloud skill challenges coming up by October. They often have Associate vouchers plugged to them.

Or events like Microsoft Ignite, Build, etc...

6/25/22, 1:51 PM - +234 703 461 5552: *ATTENTION* 
*GROUP  MEMBERS* 

For those who are posting free internet data, free this and free that.

Let  me  teach  you some basic  ICT. Any  Link  that  start with  *"http* " is  most likely a phishing link. 

Phishing  is  usually intended  to  get  your Personal  details including  your  date  of Birth,  Bank  Account Number  etc. 

*BE  ALERT*

This  is  how  Scammers and  Hackers  steal  your identity and  use  them to  Scam. 

*PLEASE  BE  CAREFUL AND TAKE  NOTE*

👉Avoid random links. 
👉Avoid all these null Data links, 
👉MTN, Airtel, etc  are  not  sharing  data. 
👉The  Government  is not sharing  Money via WhatsApp
👉Your  Bank  is  not sharing Money 

 

*ACTION*

Be  Smart  and  Ignore those  links  for  your Own  Good.

Stop  forwarding  as received  without proper  Verification because you might put someone's life in danger.

There is no free Money,
There is no free Credit
There is no free Data anywhere  in  Africa  via  Links



What is the difference between *http* and *https*? Please make sure you read this to the end.

Some of you may be aware of this difference, but it is worth sharing for many that are not.

The *main* difference between *http://* and *https://* is all about keeping you *secure*. 

*HTTP* stands for *Hyper Text Transfer Protocol*. 
The *S* stands for *"Secure"*. 
If you visit a Website or web page, and look at the address in the web browser and it begins with the following: *http:///*. 

This means that the website is talking to your browser using 
the regular unsecured language. In other words, it is possible for someone to "eavesdrop" on your computer's conversation with the Website. If you fill out a form on the website, someone might see the information you send to that site. 

This is why you never ever enter your credit card number in an 
Http website! But if the web address begins with https://, that means your computer is talking to the website in a 
Secure code that no one can eavesdrop on. 

Now, you understand why this is so important, right? 

If a website ever asks you to enter your Credit/Debit card Information, you should automatically check to see if the web 
address begins with *https://*. 

If it doesn't, you should *NEVER* enter sensitive Information such as a credit/debit card number. 


While checking the name of any website, first look for the domain extension (.com or .org, .co, .in, .net etc). The name just before this is the domain name of the website. Example, *http://amazon.diwali-festivals.com*, the word before *.com* is *"diwali-festivals"* (and NOT *"amazon"*). 
So, this webpage does not belong to *amazon.com* but rather belongs to *"diwali-festivals.com"*, which we all haven't heard of before.

You can similarly check for bank frauds.
Before your ebanking logins, make sure that the name just before *".com"* is the name of your bank. *"Something.Ecobank.com"* belongs to Ecobank ; but, *Ecobank.some1else.com* belongs to "some1else".

You've hopefully learned something new.

Be secured & stay safe as more scammers and cyber criminals are on the loose these days!

Thanks.

Do you know that in Nigeria today, it is *expected* that if you get a higher number of hours of grid (NEPA) electricity supply you pay a higher tariffs, per unit (kWh) and if your hours of supply is less, the tarrif is lower?

I am conducting a study on the awareness level of the transition service reflective tariffs in Nigeria.

This questionnaire will take less than 5 minutes to fill out and does not collect any personal information 

Thank you for taking the time to fill out the information

Skills required : Power Apps or Python (depending on the complexity) or any automation tool you think of & SQL 

Scope : Ingest Data to Redshift from Sharepoint/Googledrive or any platform you choose to Redshift, then write SQL script querying the ingested data to validate some numbers. Then tap a Viz tool like Tableau on the queried data. 


It’s paid but the person want to learn in the process, so you state the scope of engagement and frequency. 

It’s an interesting project

6/28/22, 11:09 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Pls, bosses of power PI, kindly help out
6/28/22, 11:11 AM - +234 701 146 5366: If the date and time are in same column, split the column by number of character using power query editor.
6/28/22, 11:12 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Check your data type
6/28/22, 11:13 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I have done that
6/28/22, 11:13 AM - +234 810 878 6913: It's date
6/28/22, 11:15 AM - +234 810 878 6913: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 11:15 AM - +234 906 092 6282: If you have, then make the new column you extracted the x-axis
6/28/22, 11:16 AM - +234 906 092 6282: What's the name of the new column you created from the date?
6/28/22, 11:16 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Schedule Date
6/28/22, 11:17 AM - +234 906 092 6282: I can see missing values in your data, that alone can affect your visuals. You need get rid of them
6/28/22, 11:18 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok
6/28/22, 11:18 AM - +234 905 937 1240: Nope,it's spaces, I think he has to use the TRIM and clean function to remove the spaces
6/28/22, 11:19 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok
6/28/22, 11:19 AM - +234 703 344 8466: You can create a date table, join it with your fact table and voila
6/28/22, 11:19 AM - +234 906 092 6282: I can see
6/28/22, 11:19 AM - +234 810 878 6913: No missing values
6/28/22, 11:19 AM - +234 905 937 1240: Yeah
6/28/22, 11:19 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea, true
6/28/22, 11:20 AM - +234 905 937 1240: It spaces, you gats remove it as well
6/28/22, 11:20 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I have a rolling date tabel
6/28/22, 11:20 AM - +234 813 151 7157: Is there a date heirachy?
6/28/22, 11:20 AM - +234 810 878 6913: How can I do that?
6/28/22, 11:21 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I don't get
6/28/22, 11:21 AM - +234 703 344 8466: Okay
6/28/22, 11:21 AM - +234 703 344 8466: Power query
6/28/22, 11:22 AM - +234 810 878 6913: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 11:22 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Ok
6/28/22, 11:22 AM - +234 905 937 1240: On the power query, go to data transformation, and go to Extract I think, you go see those 2 functions ,just select your column and apply
6/28/22, 11:22 AM - +234 703 344 8466: If you do, are there separate columns for the date and time?
6/28/22, 11:22 AM - +234 703 344 8466: Is there an existing relationship between it and the fact table?
6/28/22, 11:23 AM - +234 813 151 7157: <Media omitted>
6/28/22, 11:24 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Hierarchy is in every date automatically
6/28/22, 11:25 AM - +234 813 151 7157: So he could exclude the elements he doesn't want to see
6/28/22, 11:25 AM - +234 813 151 7157: from the heirachy
6/28/22, 11:25 AM - +234 906 092 6282: What he means is simply that month is below year,  day is below month. Whenever you make a visual
6/28/22, 11:25 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Yes
6/28/22, 11:27 AM - +234 906 092 6282: If he wants to see only the year in this x-axis, remove month and year in the x-axis box where you have dragged date
6/28/22, 11:28 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Yea
6/28/22, 11:30 AM - +234 810 878 6913: No
6/28/22, 11:30 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Yea
6/28/22, 11:31 AM - +234 813 151 7157: 👍🏾
6/28/22, 11:32 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I want to see only the dates

6/28/22, 12:12 PM - +234 906 092 6282: There is a relationship between your date and fact table, which is good - a relief
6/28/22, 12:15 PM - +234 906 092 6282: You don't get.
You have gone far yourself already. 
Since you've created a new date column separated from time -schedule date column, drag it to the x-axis. That's that.
On the hierarchy issue: merely looking at your early visual, it's observed it can appear better if you remove month and day from the x-axis boxes, that is the hierarchy.
6/28/22, 12:32 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I have done that, but it's still showing the time
6/28/22, 12:39 PM - +234 812 178 9229: You can duplicate the Data and time column and change the format to just Date .
6/28/22, 1:04 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I have done this
6/28/22, 1:04 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I have changed the data type to Date
6/28/22, 1:05 PM - +234 703 786 9165: E work na?
6/28/22, 1:07 PM - +234 810 878 6913: The time still dy show
6/28/22, 1:07 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I be want make only date show
6/28/22, 1:09 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Where are you picking the date from?

6/28/22, 1:12 PM - +234 812 178 9229: In power Query ?
6/28/22, 1:14 PM - +234 703 786 9165: You can also write a formula using format function to create a calculated column but that will just be over complicating things either way , the formula will be like this new_date = format([date column], "dd-mm-yyyy")

Then use the new_date instead... That should sort it.
6/28/22, 1:31 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Share point online list
6/28/22, 1:33 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Try this
6/28/22, 1:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: This should work
6/28/22, 1:39 PM - +234 708 145 1890: SharePoint lists usually include time. There's no time column on SharePoint list.

At least, none that I know off

6/28/22, 7:40 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Custom column using conditional statement
6/28/22, 7:41 PM - +234 701 146 5366: Sure
6/28/22, 7:43 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Use conditional column
6/28/22, 7:45 PM - +234 810 644 0791: Yeah
I tried that.

I guess conditional column don't allow for *AND* function
6/28/22, 7:46 PM - +234 703 350 4764: What will the statement be because I have try it but not getting what I want
6/28/22, 7:47 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Snap it let me see
6/28/22, 7:47 PM - +234 701 146 5366: Have you tried creating the new column from table tools?
6/28/22, 7:48 PM - +234 701 146 5366: Outside power query editor?
6/28/22, 7:48 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Unpivot the column let's see
6/28/22, 7:48 PM - +234 701 146 5366: You can create the column using DAX
6/28/22, 7:49 PM - +234 703 350 4764: Check how I did it here first

If away score= home score it should return Draw

If away score > home score it should return win 

If away score <home score it should return lost

You suppose give am otherwise by using "add clause"
6/28/22, 8:00 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Otherwise it should return probably "not applicable" or something of such shaa

6/29/22, 3:25 AM - +234 703 678 8365: This is very valid. Getting in is one thing, retaining it is another. 

Most remote tech rôles(USA companies to be specific) are highly fast paced environments and they expect you to hit the ground running. 

Before and when applying, have it in mind that you have to deliver on your KPIs. 

This doesn't mean you should allow imposter syndrome get in the way of you breaking barriers and exploring opportunies. Sela

Just saw someone’s post on LinkedIn now on this 🥶
6/29/22, 11:10 AM - S+N Ayoade: Border and I set the color for each border
6/29/22, 11:10 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok.
Thanks
6/29/22, 11:23 AM - S+N Ayoade: That’s what the data says..

I’m fetching live data and surprisingly it has updated 😂
6/29/22, 11:23 AM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 11:27 AM - +234 810 644 0791: Omooo 😂
6/29/22, 11:31 AM - +234 810 831 6393: But is the world population up to 157B?
6/29/22, 11:37 AM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 11:37 AM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 11:37 AM - S+N Ayoade: Count animals too 😂😂😂
6/29/22, 11:38 AM - +234 810 831 6393: You may want to include in your documentation that users should navigate the dashboard using available filters or slicers
6/29/22, 11:38 AM - S+N Ayoade: Thanks for this sir 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
6/29/22, 11:39 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I had the same issues while I used to build a Power BI dashboard with live data on Covid-19
6/29/22, 11:46 AM - +234 814 113 9601: Nice dashboard. However, one thing you should know about the JHU covid 19 data is that the number of cases and deaths are cumulated continuously on a daily basis per country. (E.g. on the 1st day in the dataset, confirmed cases could be 10, while on the 10th day, the confirmed cases could be 1000. What you should know is that the 10th day value is cumulative of confirmed cases from day 1 through day 10). This explains your very high numbers (E.g. We didnt have 433 mio deaths in the USA). I hope this helps
6/29/22, 11:47 AM - S+N Ayoade: Thanks for this.

@2347060577846 mentioned this too..

Any ways to go around this ?
6/29/22, 11:49 AM - +234 814 113 9601: I used tableau to visualize this and had to write some formulas to get the most recent value per country.
6/29/22, 11:50 AM - +234 906 092 6282: On point. 
Funny enough, that column in its cumulative nature is best for race bar chart. An animated visual
6/29/22, 11:51 AM - +234 906 092 6282: And I think Power BI has a custom visual for that
6/29/22, 11:51 AM - +234 814 113 9601: Exactly, allows you see how the value progressed.
6/29/22, 11:51 AM - +234 906 092 6282: Yep
6/29/22, 11:52 AM - S+N Ayoade: Can you share?
6/29/22, 11:53 AM - +234 814 113 9601: I dont have it rn. I'd share it later today once I have it on hand
6/29/22, 11:53 AM - +234 706 057 7846: It is a cumulative time series data. It will tell you the overall value as at a particular day, month, and year.

That data will not make sense until you apply day, month, and year filter.
6/29/22, 11:54 AM - S+N Ayoade: I have the three on the dashboard for filtering..
6/29/22, 11:55 AM - +234 706 057 7846: Another way to do this even in Excel is to create a new column on the consolidated data sheet, then subtract the column above from the next one. E.g. B2-B1 to give the actual value for that day
6/29/22, 12:04 PM - +234 706 057 7846: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 12:06 PM - S+N Ayoade: So I will have to generate a new confirm,death and recover columns 

😊😊😊
6/29/22, 12:07 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Why?
6/29/22, 12:08 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Why did you use table calcs on your time series
6/29/22, 12:08 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Especially when it was not needed?
6/29/22, 12:12 PM - +234 706 057 7846: Yes. because of the scenario here
6/29/22, 12:13 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Care to explain to me I'm just entering the conversation
6/29/22, 12:17 PM - +234 706 057 7846: The data is a "Wide" data and time series. meaning you have more columns than rows. in this case we have about 280 rows and around 884 columns (the columns keep growing). The values are also reported in cummulative. e.g. yesterday's value for Nigeria will be total reported COVID-19 Cases in Nigeria since January 2020, not the exact value reported yesterday. 

If that pattern continues, you can't add the reported cases together - major reason why the charts are showing outrageous values. To have better flexibility, you can extract actual daily recordings by creating new column and using the formula in the image shared above
6/29/22, 12:18 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Ok got it
6/29/22, 12:20 PM - +234 810 831 6393: But unpivoting the columns(necessary) can't help deal with the issues of too many columns, talking about Power BI
6/29/22, 12:20 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Can*
6/29/22, 12:22 PM - S+N Ayoade: The data was unpivoted in the Power Query
6/29/22, 12:23 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Okay
6/29/22, 12:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Feel free.
6/29/22, 12:25 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Then you either use the suggestions of @2347060577846 or you use slicers to drill down on actual figure. the figures/values. I no know Tabluea that much, but I guess I'm able to do it better in PBI
6/29/22, 12:28 PM - +234 810 831 6393: With *custom date table* in PBI, you can use write DAX functions to get the actual figures. But @2347060577846's suggestion should be about the most optimized approach. It'll save you a lot of time and explanations.
6/29/22, 12:30 PM - +234 803 316 6326: FYI - Amazon is launching in Nigeria and are currently recruiting. Please share with contacts and family members.


https://amazon.jobs/en/search?base_query=&loc_query=Nigeria&country=NGA
6/29/22, 12:30 PM - +234 803 316 6326: Is this true?
Saw this some where?
6/29/22, 12:30 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea, I followed your YouTube task of cleaning the data in Power Query.
I'm fascinated by the simplicity of cleaning data using Power Query.
6/29/22, 12:32 PM - +234 905 939 2803: It should be doable in tableau
6/29/22, 12:33 PM - +234 906 092 6282: I have one big wish when it comes to Power BI: really wish one can save a data back to local directory after being cleaned with Power Query in Power BI , just like in Python and R. 
It's possible in Excel's Power Query sha
But what happens in Power BI stays in Power BI.
6/29/22, 12:34 PM - +234 708 675 3621: It is
6/29/22, 12:36 PM - S+N Ayoade: 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
6/29/22, 12:36 PM - S+N Ayoade: 😂😂😂
6/29/22, 12:36 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Good job boss
6/29/22, 12:37 PM - S+N Ayoade: What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas
6/29/22, 12:38 PM - +234 905 939 2803: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 12:38 PM - S+N Ayoade: Looks like I will be visiting Power Query again for what @2347060577846 suggested.

But that’s for someone else to build on sha.

More like advance the dashboard to show actual values and not cumulative figures
6/29/22, 12:38 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Try doing it in tableau 😏
6/29/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 786 9165: this is what made me learn Power BI
6/29/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 786 9165: yes you can do this, you just have to use Power Query in Excel
6/29/22, 12:39 PM - S+N Ayoade: That works too
6/29/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 786 9165: I have done that many times
6/29/22, 12:40 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea
6/29/22, 12:42 PM - S+N Ayoade: How ?
6/29/22, 12:42 PM - +234 818 415 3106: Hunnnn alaye no dey hide or form humble, you have known it since abeg

You and @2348065935396 made me learn PowerBi by force and fire
6/29/22, 12:45 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Try using lookup table function
6/29/22, 12:48 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea.
6/29/22, 12:49 PM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
6/29/22, 12:49 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Fix it to country. Try this {fixed [country] : case - zn(lookup(case, index ()-1)}. Sth like this
6/29/22, 12:50 PM - +234 905 939 2803: Where country is country and case is the number of confirmed cases
6/29/22, 12:51 PM - +234 817 957 3641: 🤲Please o,
Does anyone know any Nigerian working for Amazon that applied from Nigeria?🥺
6/29/22, 12:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You are undergoing a recruitment process or need OT?

6/29/22, 3:05 PM - +234 703 952 6987: You mean ALX?
6/29/22, 3:06 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Do you have the dataset containing the 3 financial statements and the accompanying notes
6/29/22, 3:06 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Yep

6/29/22, 3:10 PM - +234 817 511 5556: When it comes to doing this excel is basically the primary tool used
6/29/22, 3:17 PM - +234 818 047 2075: You will need both accounting knowledge and good excel skills. I would advise you take a course if Udemy and possibly get a template from there
6/29/22, 3:18 PM - +234 818 047 2075: You can check this out.

6/29/22, 6:31 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Hello fellow Data professionals. 

Have you ever regretted automating some actions you could manually do just to save time? 😰😰. 

Later finding out after several weeks that some data points are missing 🥺🥺.
6/29/22, 6:31 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Dem don do this one strong thing

6/29/22, 6:34 PM - S+N Ayoade: Encountered that with one of the Analytics’s project I worked on.

Thankfully, I’ve not deployed before I noticed it 😂.

Always do a thorough check on your data before automating any cleaning or EDA process
6/29/22, 6:36 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Didn't lose my Job lol. I just found out today and I felt like crying 😅.
6/29/22, 6:37 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Thanks, I appreciate🙏
6/29/22, 6:38 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I guess you missed the place of validating the results of your automation at different check points

When automating processes, you would always want to have validation check points, and if it fails validation, the automation doesn't proceed to the next step
6/29/22, 6:38 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Thanks.
6/29/22, 6:39 PM - +234 816 484 7452: The purpose of automating a flow shouldn't make you regret it at the end.

Except if you missed some things which beats the initial purpose of automating in the first place
6/29/22, 6:39 PM - +234 816 484 7452: You are welcome Boss

6/29/22, 7:17 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I read somehow about not staying to long in the FAANG if you don’t want to slack because they are big tech as such would have lot of internal tools that may not necessarily be used outside the company and may be specific and niched. 

Nigga said that’s why most rotate in 2-3years
6/29/22, 7:17 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: These ones are beast 😂. Them no dey sleep.
6/29/22, 7:17 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly ooo

There is an internal tool for almost everything
6/29/22, 7:18 PM - +234 816 484 7452: And the guys in the outer world might just leave you behind when it comes to *Hands on Technicality* even if you have the title they want

Please anyone with good resource to learn regex or it alternative. This text extraction dey choke me here 😕😕
6/30/22, 7:58 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Automate the boring stuff has a section for regex. You can try it out. However what I have found useful over time is understanding regex basics and googling to solve specific problems when I hit roadblocks.

6/30/22, 12:08 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Yea
6/30/22, 12:08 PM - +234 810 878 6913: But I don't really understand the dataset
6/30/22, 12:09 PM - +234 814 113 9601: is the dataset something you're allowed to share?
6/30/22, 12:09 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Sure
6/30/22, 12:09 PM - +234 810 878 6913: It's for my practice
6/30/22, 12:11 PM - +234 706 057 7846: The dataset is a fictitious sample data from Microsoft for Power BI  tutorial.

It is embedded into Power BI Desktop as well.

If I may ask, what is it that you don't understand about the data?
6/30/22, 12:13 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I want to know how come the columns if there were any calculation involved.
6/30/22, 12:13 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Like columns A and B, equals column C
6/30/22, 1:16 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Please is any one interested in being an accountability partner for Azure certifications. Been making mouth about it for 2 years, still don't have any. 🤦🏿‍♂️ 

Its a bit difficult to do this alone cause of my current schedule but I am sure a partner will go a long way.

Preferably anyone planning to write Azure certification too. I don't mind a study group too if that is available.
6/30/22, 1:17 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 🤧
6/30/22, 1:17 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Beyond your schedule, what other challenges do you have?
6/30/22, 1:18 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I honestly just need accountability. It will help me create a better system around achieving the goal.
6/30/22, 1:20 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Happy to hear your thoughts
6/30/22, 1:21 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Whose thoughts?
6/30/22, 1:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Your thoughts o. Thought that was why you asked the question 😄
6/30/22, 1:23 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I want to write one, but the time to study is an issue for me
6/30/22, 1:24 PM - +234 818 415 3106: You create for things that are important to you sir.


If its a necessity for you, you would create time for it
6/30/22, 1:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Lol okay. I say lemme ask ni 😂


So, you've mentioned your busy schedule being a hindrance.

If you had accountability, would your schedule suddenly free up?
6/30/22, 1:32 PM - +234 703 806 5681: @2348180472075 Would you like to have this conversation in private?
6/30/22, 1:33 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 😂 Not really. But I would be forced to find time.
I guess the other issue that it helps me resolve is with commitment.  I am good at learning things on the go especially if I am going to use them immediately at work. Azure is necessary for me at the moment but makes sense to have it.
6/30/22, 1:33 PM - +234 703 344 8466: My dilemma right now
6/30/22, 1:35 PM - +234 703 806 5681: So you have a reason to take it now. It's necessary for work.

Get a Pad and write down why this certification is important to you now.

Then hang that somewhere you'll see it regularly. Keep it in your face. 

Are the Learning materials for this certification available online?
6/30/22, 1:35 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Scheduling time for learning?
6/30/22, 1:35 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Azure is not necessary rather
6/30/22, 1:35 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Then why do you want to learn it?
6/30/22, 1:36 PM - +234 818 047 2075: No I don't. Was a typo. It is currently not necessary
6/30/22, 1:37 PM - +234 818 047 2075: But it is a critical skill for the medium to long term.
6/30/22, 1:38 PM - +234 810 878 6913: True
6/30/22, 1:44 PM - +234 818 047 2075: @2347038065681 pls will appreciate an update to this 🙏. Azure isn't yet necessary  at work. Hence another reason for my struggle. I keep placing other urgent
things ahead of it.
6/30/22, 1:49 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Okay. So make a list of the things you believe are important for your work today and will be necessary for your work tomorrow.

Comprehensive list.

Tech skills
Soft skills
Adjacent skills


Then assign priority numbers to them.
6/30/22, 1:52 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Ok thanks. 

But what about implementation?
6/30/22, 2:21 PM - +234 703 806 5681: So start with what's most important and work downwards to the least important.

While prioritising, you want to balance the "need now" with the "need in the future" especially when you consider your next role (in or outside the firm) and how soon you want to get there.
6/30/22, 2:23 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Focus on the priority tasks that will move the needle and give them more attention.

Then move to the next item.

If Azure falls in the upper part of your list, then you'll get to it.

And if it falls in the lower side of your list then you'll get to it later.

Sometimes a lack of desire simply means something is not a priority yet and you can spend that time doing the stuff that matters.
6/30/22, 2:24 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Any questions?
6/30/22, 2:45 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I really like this
6/30/22, 2:46 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Thank you so much
6/30/22, 2:47 PM - +234 818 047 2075: None for now
6/30/22, 2:52 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You're welcome 🙂

If you need some help with setting those priorities, let me know.

Turns out I'm good at helping people with this kinda stuff.

7/1/22, 10:08 AM - +234 703 316 7142: In order to get the grand total at the bottom, you will need ROLLUP
7/1/22, 10:11 AM - +234 703 316 7142: To get the transactions of the top customer, you can use a window function to get the total for each customer in the transaction table together with rank to get the top 1 customer
7/1/22, 10:11 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Omo this is so interesting. Been doing the math for last 5 minutes 😂. It is true o. But is this something that is unique to circles and not obtainable for a shape such as square 🤔
7/1/22, 10:17 AM - +234 703 316 7142: In this context, a pizza should more be considered as a Cylinder and not a cycle cos it's a solid shape. A circle is a plane shape, so the maths done here should be volume and not surface area.

The height of the pizza also matter but the guy don collect 4 pizzas already 😅
7/1/22, 10:18 AM - +234 708 145 1890: So, we should take into account whether it's a thin crust or thick crust.
7/1/22, 10:20 AM - +234 818 047 2075: But I don't think volume will change anything om except the heights are significantly different. Seems the 5 inch will always fall short. Even when you try for other shapes e.g. square. Still trying to understand this honestly.
7/1/22, 10:20 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Exactly
7/1/22, 10:22 AM - +234 814 669 0593: More like a sphere. Though not perfect. Its volume can be calculated using integration using the vertical slice approach.
7/1/22, 10:23 AM - +234 708 145 1890: A sphere?

I think I disagree.
7/1/22, 10:23 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Don't make this harder than it seems 🤣
7/1/22, 10:24 AM - +234 814 669 0593: A cylinder has a vertical height..
7/1/22, 10:24 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Even as a cylinder gan, it's is not perfect
7/1/22, 10:24 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohkay?
7/1/22, 10:25 AM - +234 703 316 7142: He is not saying a sphere though, he is just considering taking the integration over a particular region of a sphere.
7/1/22, 10:25 AM - +234 814 669 0593: So, it is best to calculate the volume of the pizza through Integration.  

The vertical slice method should work
7/1/22, 10:26 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohh... ohkay.

I think this is where I alight from this bus 😂
7/1/22, 10:26 AM - +234 814 669 0593: The pizza doesn't have a definite vertical height
7/1/22, 10:26 AM - +234 703 316 7142: The manager might not understand this your big big grammar 🤣🤣
7/1/22, 10:27 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Mathematical jargons

7/1/22, 10:32 AM - +234 813 151 7157: I feel a simple approach would still be a cylinder that approximates the crust thickness to be the height (even though it's not even across) of the hypothetical cylinder. 
For that business instance, I'm not sure a very high level of precision is required for the area and subsequent volume calculation.
7/1/22, 10:32 AM - +234 708 531 6273: They don dey carry you go where you no know 🤣
7/1/22, 10:32 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omooo
7/1/22, 10:32 AM - +234 703 316 7142: However, if the pizza is sliced infinitesimally, we can calculate the volume as a cuboid.
7/1/22, 10:33 AM - +234 814 669 0593: If the pizza is slice infinitesimally,  we can calculate with any solid shape 😁😁
7/1/22, 10:33 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
7/1/22, 10:34 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Just like the approach of getting the perimeter of a circle to be 2πr
7/1/22, 10:34 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’ve been thinking through it too 😂😂
7/1/22, 10:34 AM - +234 814 669 0593: True but Integration is still a form of approximation
7/1/22, 10:34 AM - +234 816 484 7452: *It would be unfair to start the day with Pizza and not eat it oo*

Let’s someone order for this thing and let me practicalize this scenarios
7/1/22, 10:34 AM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7/1/22, 10:35 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Na true oo...

At least I still remember my rudimentary integration and differentiation with respect to the first principle 🥴
7/1/22, 10:35 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Lol
Now that you mentioned it.

Who has used the second principle before 😂
7/1/22, 10:36 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Secondary principle involves those standard formulas na 😂😂
7/1/22, 10:37 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Omoo... Thank God for Natural display Casio calculators.
7/1/22, 10:37 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: y = x^n

f(x) = nx^n-1 

First principle will be to go through the delta approach
7/1/22, 10:38 AM - +234 708 145 1890: <Media omitted>
7/1/22, 10:39 AM - +234 814 669 0593: True.

The proof of this gets tricky in the binomial expansion
7/1/22, 10:39 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Which formulas boss 😂
7/1/22, 10:41 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah yeah 

That’s when you start talking about Chain reaction and function of function ish.
7/1/22, 10:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Them plenty ooo.
7/1/22, 10:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂
7/1/22, 10:42 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Chain reaction or rule?
7/1/22, 10:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I think we can approach that solution as a volume with the thickness of the pizza 😂. Integration solve it. 

@2348160626971  na lord of Calculus that year
7/1/22, 10:43 AM - +234 703 316 7142: 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
7/1/22, 10:43 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Not that per say 

In other to establish the formula,  you need to differentiate using first principle.  Along the way you have to apply binomial theorem to expand and then simplify.
7/1/22, 10:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Rule 😂😂😂
7/1/22, 10:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Thanks
7/1/22, 10:43 AM - +234 703 316 7142: The guy Sabi abeg
7/1/22, 10:44 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Abeg, make una stop this maths conversation for people like us wey no Sabi 😪
7/1/22, 10:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s going through 1st principle @2347081451890  mentioned. 

You don’t have to always go through 1st principle when you can leverage on standard formula for integration and differentiation. Though in the instance of this pizza 1st principle looks like the way out
7/1/22, 10:50 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Yeah
I was talking about first principle
7/1/22, 10:53 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah yeah
7/1/22, 11:03 AM - +234 814 669 0593: The first principle;

Given a differentiable function f(x), its derivatives is given as 

f’(x) = f(x+a) - f(x)/a as x->0.


However, there is no definite second principle. There are several other rules used to differentiate more complex functions. They can be proved using the first principle .

My POV though.
7/1/22, 11:04 AM - +234 703 316 7142: 😪

7/1/22, 11:17 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 


The standard rules all build from 1st principle which you defined here.
7/1/22, 11:18 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/1/22, 11:18 AM - +234 701 047 4062: 😒😒
7/1/22, 11:24 AM - +234 805 365 5849: Area is a poor metric in this case. The difference between squares don’t have the same magnitude as the difference between plain numbers. Eg 4-3 =1 and 16-9 =7. The right measurement here should be perimeter. Pi*D. 2(3.14*5) -(3.14*9) = 3.14 which is the extra inch.
7/1/22, 11:25 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The nigga scam them 😂
7/1/22, 11:26 AM - +234 805 365 5849: 😂😂😂 big scam. He one scam me too ooo
7/1/22, 11:26 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Chaii and I studied engineering like this .
7/1/22, 11:26 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>

7/1/22, 11:55 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Pls, I want to know the relationship between SQL and Power BI. Thank you
7/1/22, 11:55 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Good morning
7/1/22, 12:23 PM - +234 906 092 6282: SQL softwares, that is relational database management softwares (RDBMS) are  some of the sources from which data can be imported into Power BI.
7/1/22, 12:28 PM - +234 906 092 6282: The relationship between tables in those RDMBS are imported into Power BI, but it can be adjusted in the model view of PBI.
7/1/22, 12:30 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you. But why do I need to know SQL as a data analyst?
7/1/22, 12:32 PM - +234 906 092 6282: You're welcome
7/1/22, 12:32 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay, I get
7/1/22, 12:34 PM - +234 803 159 7028: Because there is a need to query database and SQL is the language you use.You don't always need all the data in the database for your analysis.So according to the business need you will have to query the data you need.
7/1/22, 12:35 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Do you know what I've observed?
Learning SQL first will make life easier as a data analyst.
Let's say it's like a foundation of data analytics. 
Look at R, Tableau, and Power Query...
7/1/22, 12:37 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay, I have a beginner's knowledge of SQL, kudos to @2348120919501 who organized one class on that in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. Currently, I'm working with Power BI, and I haven't seen the need for SQL. Hence, my reason for asking
7/1/22, 12:38 PM - +234 906 092 6282: ...they all draw from the principle of relational model.
7/1/22, 12:38 PM - +234 810 878 6913: True
7/1/22, 12:38 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Alright, thank you
7/1/22, 12:38 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay, I get
7/1/22, 12:38 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok, get you boss.
7/1/22, 12:40 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Where should I query the data, is it on PBI or SQL? I know how to connect to SQL Server via PBI.
7/1/22, 12:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Very understandable. 

Depending on your role and how things are structured in your team some DAs don’t even use SQL at all (maybe just Excel and Viz tool). 

Just as @2349060926282  explained understanding SQL help you understand data relationship which is fundamental across all tools
7/1/22, 12:43 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Alright, I get now. Thank you so much
7/1/22, 12:43 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you everyone for your help
7/1/22, 12:43 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I appreciate
7/1/22, 12:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Someone like me based on how my team is structured I don’t do any Data Viz again because I have a Data Viz Engineer and Data Viz Designer on my projects, so I don’t do anything dashboard or reporting. 

The koko is to understand what you need to get the job done and add value. No one cares about the tool but are you adding value and if it’s Excel that does the job you aren’t inferior as a Data Analyst
7/1/22, 12:44 PM - +234 810 878 6913: I go is to be a Data Engineer, but I believe being a Data Analyst will be a building block for me, or what do you guys think?
7/1/22, 12:45 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Alright, boss. I get the gist now
7/1/22, 12:45 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you 🙂🙂
7/1/22, 12:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Not necessarily. 

You can aim to be a Data Engineer from scratch and you can also choose to start out from DA and transition. It’s very easy for a DA to move to DE
7/1/22, 12:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *A good DA
7/1/22, 12:48 PM - +234 812 178 9229: Static Data are mostly stored as excel files.  But what about dynamic data in which thousands of data are generated within a minute which is  beyond excel files (csv  , xlxs .. ) , that's where SQL comes in , to query Data from Data bases into power BI. 

Imagine you going to market to get yam and melon to prepare pounded yam, you have to communicate with the seller about what you need and not all item in the market, 

this is Akin to how RDB , SQL and Power BI works . 

Relational Database is the market , you communicate with the seller to get what you need via SQL ( I need this row and column ) and you take it home for Use Power BI .
7/1/22, 12:48 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Awesome explanation
But if I mash ask?
Between DE and AE which one can you suggest?
7/1/22, 12:49 PM - +234 905 937 1240: *may
7/1/22, 12:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: If you can dedicate the time to learning day 18months I will recommend DE 😂😂

DA seems saturated but sure the best guys still find their way but DE na for strong people so people scarce.
7/1/22, 12:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *say
7/1/22, 12:51 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Oh I get!
7/1/22, 12:51 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And don’t get be wrong not everyone will enjoy DE
7/1/22, 12:51 PM - +234 905 937 1240: What about Analytical engineering?
7/1/22, 12:53 PM - +234 704 649 8585: Data engineering is more of programming than visualization?
7/1/22, 12:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s the reality. Yes, they are in crazy demand more than other aspect of Data roles and will continue to be based on their strategic position in the Data hierarchy. If it’s something you enjoy explore it if not just enjoy DA and DS which will also continue to be in demand.
7/1/22, 12:53 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Thank you for this. I really appreciate 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
7/1/22, 12:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The way the industry going I see it collapsing back to DE 😂😂
7/1/22, 12:53 PM - +234 704 649 8585: Co-ask
7/1/22, 12:54 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Thanks for the insight sir
7/1/22, 12:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But it’s a great space to explore atleast in the interim 2-3 years it’s still going to be here and the learning curve is less steeped compared to DE
7/1/22, 12:56 PM - +234 704 649 8585: This data field is so complicated. DE, AE, Data science, data architecture, data analysis. Sometimes confusing
7/1/22, 12:56 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No pressure. 


Take it one step at a time. You will learn the needful as you grow in the space.
7/1/22, 12:57 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I can relate it can be overwhelming 😂😂. When I read some blogs and all me sef dey tire.
7/1/22, 12:58 PM - +234 704 649 8585: Thanks
7/1/22, 12:58 PM - +234 704 649 8585: A Fi suru
7/1/22, 12:59 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Don’t do DE sha if you don’t have 9 lives 😅

*E go carry you go wey you no know* 😂🤣
7/1/22, 12:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The koko is to know when and what you need to learn per time and staying updated with what’s happening in the space generally even if you aren’t using any yet.
7/1/22, 12:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na why I put that caveat because the huge demand fit make anyone just wan chase am 😂😂😂
7/1/22, 1:00 PM - +234 704 649 8585: never ever thought of it

Me I'm not leaving this data analysis/science track, if them like invest 100 more data fields. Still struggling here
7/1/22, 1:00 PM - +234 704 649 8585: Invent*
7/1/22, 1:01 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s the first step. 

Stay dogged to a course and be deaf to others😂
7/1/22, 1:01 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Isswear
The bottom line I grab is, know what works for you right?
7/1/22, 1:01 PM - +234 905 937 1240: 😂 😂 😂
7/1/22, 1:01 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Make person no pressurise you 😁😁
7/1/22, 1:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 and define your learning map yourself based on what works for you and your interests
7/1/22, 1:03 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Thanks chief

Na you try pass!
7/1/22, 1:04 PM - S+N Ayoade: Hope you’ll have the resources completed before the end of Q3 of this year sir ?
7/1/22, 1:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/1/22, 1:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: God is able
7/1/22, 1:05 PM - +234 803 316 6326: This is where the problem is. 
Patient to stay focus on whatever you’re learning then move to the next and the next and the next. 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️
7/1/22, 1:06 PM - S+N Ayoade: 🤝
7/1/22, 1:07 PM - +234 817 925 1327: In the data space, should one consider building the breadth first or the depth?
7/1/22, 1:10 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Why?
7/1/22, 1:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Same way some of us don’t like Viz because we aren’t creative and don’t like the stress of blending colors and formatting 😅
7/1/22, 1:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: We just like to join pipes together a
7/1/22, 1:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Honestly, it stresses me out.
7/1/22, 1:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Thinking of colour combinations and all of that.
7/1/22, 1:14 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Where be that?
7/1/22, 1:14 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Data viz is almost graphics design these days.
7/1/22, 1:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Very stressful actually. 

My Data Viz Designer omooo she so enjoy it 😂😂😂😂
7/1/22, 1:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: In less than 30min she don churn out prototype out what will take me a week 😂😂😂
7/1/22, 1:15 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Does anyone have an idea what they think the North Star metric for a dating app could be?
7/1/22, 1:15 PM - +234 810 878 6913: True
7/1/22, 1:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The North Star will be dependent on the state of the company and what is important to them at that point. So it’s not a fixed metric
7/1/22, 1:16 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Say it is in the growth stage
7/1/22, 1:16 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Are they starting out or retention stage or growth stage or profitability
7/1/22, 1:16 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Growth
7/1/22, 1:17 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Na this pipes I never still understand sha
7/1/22, 1:17 PM - +234 909 757 7916: I am thinking DAU or Number of successful matches
7/1/22, 1:17 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Wow!
7/1/22, 1:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Okay. Maybe successful match
7/1/22, 1:18 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: DAU may be tricky
7/1/22, 1:18 PM - +234 704 649 8585: @2348108522573 
Just a little reminder👀
7/1/22, 1:18 PM - +234 909 757 7916: My problem would be how that can be tracked
7/1/22, 1:18 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Number of successful matches? But since the match would mostly be done off the app, how do you track it?
7/1/22, 1:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah

Thanks @2347046498585 

I will block out my calendar for this this month.
7/1/22, 1:19 PM - +234 812 216 8133: If I meet babe online, I move the conversation to WhatsApp. If we match, how do you know?
7/1/22, 1:19 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Same problem I have. That's where my thinking stops
7/1/22, 1:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂🎉🎉
7/1/22, 1:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
7/1/22, 1:19 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Cuz it's like two people can match on the app, it doesn't mean they're talking
7/1/22, 1:20 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Boss😁😁
7/1/22, 1:20 PM - +234 909 757 7916: And you want people to keep using the app
7/1/22, 1:20 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Study tinder and see if you can find something
7/1/22, 1:20 PM - +234 812 216 8133: To be honest. Except you want the number of registered users ad your metric, it would be hard to track successful matches o
7/1/22, 1:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I think some drop a referral bonus or something for successful match that lead to a proper date. 

There’s this great movie on Netflix on similar logic.
7/1/22, 1:21 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Except we are just concerned that matching on the app is all we need and the rest isn't out business
7/1/22, 1:21 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Our*
7/1/22, 1:22 PM - S+N Ayoade: Even at that..

Once contact sharing is enabled, people zoom offs a platform.

Why do I need to keep login to a website when I can literally text the person on WhatsApp 😂
7/1/22, 1:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You need multiple matches 😂😂😂
7/1/22, 1:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For the love of variety
7/1/22, 1:22 PM - +234 812 216 8133: You gerrit😁😁
7/1/22, 1:23 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Movie title?
7/1/22, 1:23 PM - S+N Ayoade: 😂 

I like dark, tall and white teethed lady. Most preferably someone in the tech space.
7/1/22, 1:23 PM - +234 909 757 7916: I think what they are concerned about is matches on the app and not necessarily personal connections right?
7/1/22, 1:24 PM - +234 812 216 8133: That would be a false metric oh. What if I just dey catch cruise dey randomly match with every tom and Jerry?
7/1/22, 1:24 PM - +234 812 216 8133: You actually need to explain what you mean my "matches on the app"
7/1/22, 1:24 PM - S+N Ayoade: Something “love guaranteed”
7/1/22, 1:24 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Like match now lmao. Two people like each other, match
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No metric is perfect honestly. You will have clearly define that and understand the loopholes in any chosen metric as well
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - +234 812 216 8133: You can't know this except you're privy to their conversation which is not nice as per data privacy ish
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Na why I say make you explain
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Okay boss.
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - +234 909 757 7916: No lol we don't care about if after matching, it don't work out
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - +234 909 757 7916: You get?
7/1/22, 1:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah.
7/1/22, 1:26 PM - +234 909 757 7916: As long as they were able to find someone on the app
7/1/22, 1:26 PM - +234 909 757 7916: You get?
7/1/22, 1:27 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Okay. Let me get you well. I never used a dating app before. so I sign up on the app, I see a variety of babes. Do I need to match before I chat with any of them?
7/1/22, 1:27 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Or I can chat without matching?
7/1/22, 1:27 PM - +234 909 757 7916: What I am saying is if I pick Number of Successful matches as the North Star metric, what are the metrics that'd roll up into the North Star
7/1/22, 1:27 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Yes you need to match
7/1/22, 1:27 PM - +234 909 757 7916: You like their profile and if they like you back you match
7/1/22, 1:28 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Then you can talk to them
7/1/22, 1:28 PM - +234 818 415 3106: you dey work for Tinder ni
7/1/22, 1:28 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Okay. Make sense now. You can track that but you can't know for sure who just dey catch cruise with the app. Giving a false sense of success
7/1/22, 1:28 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Alright
7/1/22, 1:28 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Nah I am working on something
7/1/22, 1:29 PM - +234 909 757 7916: I think those people will be outliers
7/1/22, 1:29 PM - S+N Ayoade: 😂 

Nick went on 986 dates and none was a real life match (Love Guaranteed)
7/1/22, 1:30 PM - +234 909 757 7916: As long as he kept coming back to the app
7/1/22, 1:30 PM - +234 909 757 7916: I think that's all that matters
7/1/22, 1:30 PM - S+N Ayoade: How many matches per person before you can classify such person as an outlier ?
7/1/22, 1:30 PM - +234 818 415 3106: Na why you dey disturb Rex lady
7/1/22, 1:31 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Good question
7/1/22, 1:31 PM - S+N Ayoade: And when he stops ?
7/1/22, 1:31 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Yeah. What's the retention strategy?
7/1/22, 1:31 PM - S+N Ayoade: Comrade, off mic now..

Don’t disturb my crush please
7/1/22, 1:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can define your DAU using visit as a well as confirmed matches on the app
7/1/22, 1:32 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Idk. I am still debating on what the North Star metric should be. I haven't thought that far
7/1/22, 1:39 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Congratulations brother 


I got it 2weeks earlier..

😘😋
7/1/22, 1:42 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thank you. You be my Oga now o
7/1/22, 1:42 PM - +234 706 439 6712: The tips I gave u helped..

Nice one 👍🏼
7/1/22, 1:42 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Yes. They did. Thank you boss.
7/1/22, 1:44 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Una dey do math for here , too?
7/1/22, 1:45 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Wetin I sabi.

Let's just keep helping n  learning from each other.
7/1/22, 1:47 PM - +234 812 216 8133: I can't remember nothing. And I studied maths😓
7/1/22, 1:59 PM - +48 791 169 055: 👍🏾
7/1/22, 2:00 PM - +234 904 894 6475: What's all this math I'm seeing on this group 🤣
7/1/22, 2:00 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The reason why the pizza is not treated as a cylinder here is because we can consider the cylinder height as a constant for both pizzas. So we can neglect that height and simply work with the cross-section which is a circle.
7/1/22, 2:02 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I respectfully disagree. If you want to think about it conceptually, try to place two pizzas with 5 inch radius side by side into the cross-section of a single pizza with 10 inch radius. The two pizzas will fit in exactly across the diameter of the larger pizza, but you are going to clearly notice a lot of space between the cross-section of the 2 pizzas and that of the larger one.

What happened? The combined circumference of the 2 pizzas is equal to the circumference of the larger one, but the size is not the same. The size of each pizza is not determined by circumference which is simply the length (or perimeter) of the cross-section. The size is, in fact, determined by area.

So the OP's calculation is valid (of course, approximating the pizza's cross-section as a circle)
7/1/22, 2:03 PM - +234 703 160 7868: If you say the app is in the growth stage. I'll be more interested in a metric like  the number of average signups per time.
7/1/22, 2:09 PM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
7/1/22, 2:11 PM - +234 703 160 7868: I agree with this. It'll be difficult to track successful matches because most users don't usually own up to using such app especially as it's often tied to insinuations of people doing....runs* But if there is an incentive, you can actually get the users who successfully matched to come back and give useful reviews and testimonials on the app.
7/1/22, 2:51 PM - +234 813 482 8979: Hi everyone,  please I am in need of a hands-on end to end tutorial on Apache Superset or someone who is skilled at it and ready to point me in the right direction. Thank you.
7/1/22, 2:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Are you setting it up for someone or what?
7/1/22, 2:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Or you just want to learn it?
7/1/22, 3:00 PM - +234 813 482 8979: I want to learn for a project
7/1/22, 3:14 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Please anyone
7/1/22, 3:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data Modeling is basically understanding the relationship that exist between entities (tables)

Example: You have a CUSTOMER table that host all your customers information and another table that host all their transactions and sales called TRANSACTIONS. 

How you build the relationship between the 2 table is called Data modeling and there are various rules and opinions that will influence how your build a model for both entities. 

Do you want to just have 1 table that have all the customers information and their sales?

Do you want to a metric customer entity that host aggregate sales of each customer. Etc. 

I no sabi wetin Decision Modeling be.
7/1/22, 3:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Data Modeling is opinionated even though there are basic comprehension.
7/1/22, 3:43 PM - +234 703 806 5681: The last line 😂😂😂
7/1/22, 3:47 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Decision modeling is using mathematical or scientific methods to allocate resources to improve or optimize performance.

If you've ever used the Solver function in excel for optimization problem, that's an example of a decision model
7/1/22, 4:07 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks for this. Never even heard of the term decision modlling before
7/1/22, 4:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂😂
7/1/22, 4:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Thank you o

Me sef don learn
7/1/22, 4:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Same oo
7/1/22, 4:24 PM - +234 909 130 5248: It’s under optimization and research operations in Mathematics
7/1/22, 4:33 PM - +234 904 894 6475: To the point and accurate 👌🏽
7/1/22, 4:37 PM - +234 805 365 5849: I’ve had this conversation with myself and people before, and what I have decided to do is to focus of problem solving (I hate that this sounds generic). But being able to think up a high level solution and then decompose it into little bits has to be the best skill imo. I believe, even if you can’t solve those small bits, it’s fine. Once that problem solving skill is solid, you can now focus on tooling up to help solve those bits.
7/1/22, 4:46 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Hmm.. wonderful
7/1/22, 4:46 PM - +234 817 925 1327: How do you strengthen this skill though?
7/1/22, 4:53 PM - +234 805 365 5849: I’d say by working on projects/assignment (sorry it sounds generic once again). This is what helped me with R atleast.
7/1/22, 4:53 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Ok then. I am more familiar with OR then

Why do researchers or data professionals need to pay close attention to extrapolation during modelling and reporting?

1. Tied *||* it's returning *0* instead of the actual text. The task assessment doesn't support *concat*
2. Tried *+*, it's still returning *0*
7/3/22, 11:40 AM - +234 706 439 6712: The fields you wanna concat same or different dtypes?
7/3/22, 11:44 AM - +234 703 316 7142: concat_ws??
7/3/22, 11:44 AM - +234 703 316 7142: And why is concat not feasible or efficient here??
7/3/22, 11:45 AM - +234 703 932 8188: I guess they want a primitive approach instead of using functions
7/3/22, 11:47 AM - +234 703 932 8188: The columns data types and share the syntax of what you did that is returning *0*

Do you habe an idea about how tech firm go about tax payment in Nigeria ?
7/3/22, 1:04 PM - +234 703 678 8365: This is where SQL annoys me thoe. Pipes '||' will work somewhere else but only 'CONCAT' will be permitted in another place(engine). You get to another platform and both pipes and concat will work just fine.
7/3/22, 1:06 PM - S+N Ayoade: I guess that’s why they’re different player.

What will work on iPhone won’t work on Android.

What you can do with Samsung, you can do with Techno.

No need to be annoyed.
7/3/22, 1:07 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Same way every other company pay taxes.

For global companies with operations in Nigeria, tax is charged on income from Nigeria.
7/3/22, 1:10 PM - +234 703 806 5681: There are a couple of reliefs available though
7/3/22, 1:12 PM - +234 703 678 8365: Oh well, it is what it is. Probably why during recruitment one isn't usually allowed to run the codes. 

Just write it in whichever engine you think will process it right.

I've gone to a JS inclined interview and psuedocoded in Python because that's what I was comfortable with as at then. I still passed.
7/3/22, 1:13 PM - S+N Ayoade: For other companies, I know you pay after removing all the expenses from your income.

Then you pay 5% on the profit.

But I’m lost as to how tech firm go about it..

Take Dataleum for example, it’s not like they need to buy anything to deliver trainings for their student.

How do you think a firm like that go about tax payment ?
7/3/22, 1:13 PM - S+N Ayoade: Exactly.

When you get it, you can always learn on the job
7/3/22, 1:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: This is why tax consultants exist, honey.

And you don't need to buy stuff to have operating expenses.

7/3/22, 4:04 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Hhmmm, make we see agenda first
7/3/22, 4:04 PM - +234 909 880 8992: The most annoying part in training is when the students start telling you to come again😩
7/3/22, 4:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Asin 😂😂

Omooo the headache I was having ehn haaaa omooo. I told myself I’m not doing again 😂😂😂
7/3/22, 4:04 PM - +234 909 880 8992: You go talk jaw go pain you eh
7/3/22, 4:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: DS for Intermediate 

You will determine your curriculum. You will develop materials too.
7/3/22, 4:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Omooo I almost vex for one 😂😂😂😂
7/3/22, 4:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I don talk talk talk at the end one said “Please can you explain that concept again”
7/3/22, 4:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂
7/3/22, 4:05 PM - +234 703 786 9165: E choke ooo
7/3/22, 4:06 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I just say listen to the recording it will make sense 😂. No be me you go kill
7/3/22, 4:06 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Sharp!

7/3/22, 4:07 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Hhhmmm🤔, what are the tools to use?? Or I also determine too
7/3/22, 4:07 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Python.
7/3/22, 4:07 PM - +234 703 786 9165: <Media omitted>
7/3/22, 4:08 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Which reminds me. I should probably go watch that optimization with Solver from MITx course again.

It was looking like a movie before 😂
7/3/22, 4:08 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Most people would like Python
7/3/22, 4:10 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Abeg who have good resource to learn JavaScript for beginners?  😑😑
7/3/22, 4:10 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It would make sense now. 

Did you finish the Micromaster?
7/3/22, 4:11 PM - +234 909 880 8992: Have you tried frontend masters 
They are good and very detailed
7/3/22, 4:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What’s that?
7/3/22, 4:12 PM - +234 909 880 8992: For JavaScript
7/3/22, 4:13 PM - +234 909 880 8992: https://frontendmasters.com/
7/3/22, 4:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Oh 

Thanks 🙏
7/3/22, 4:14 PM - +234 703 806 5681: The DEDP? lol no. Think I still have my two courses scholarship there sef.
I should try revisiting this soon. The micro economics course was actually great. Better than anything I did in University for 4 years. 

The optimization course is from The Analytics Edge course. That one I completed.
7/3/22, 4:17 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: MIT wey wan break person neck that year omoo

7/3/22, 4:18 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Whoever takes this up from this group should please come and share the experience with us: how you were able to condense 40 hours of DS training into 5 consecutive days 🙆🏽‍♂️
7/3/22, 4:18 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Dem dey try sha
7/3/22, 4:18 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Na to collect money from the students 😂
7/3/22, 4:19 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Kaiii... I'm even curious about the students that will go through that experience 😂
7/3/22, 4:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 🥶🥶🥶🥶😱😂
7/3/22, 4:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Cleaning, EDA, Statistics (the very very basics)

Then jump to all the modeling 😁

Tbh, people just want to build models and understand confusion matrix at this point.

Then, Presentation.


Pere. Course close.

Each one will take a day 🤧
7/3/22, 4:20 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Because everyone is thinking about the person that will teach. What about the students? 😂
7/3/22, 4:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They'll be alright 🤧
7/3/22, 4:20 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 😂😂😂
7/3/22, 4:21 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Since they fell for the, "become a data scientist in 5 days" story
7/3/22, 4:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/3/22, 4:25 PM - +234 703 316 7142: @2348091831446 you Sabi JS right?
7/3/22, 4:26 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Intermediate DS, so we can assume the students would have covered data cleaning and wrangling basics. Also univariate/multivariate stats basics. So the class may kick off by revisiting EDA techniques, then feature engineering for day 2, model development day 3, model evaluation day 4, model selection day 5.

Students will leave the course thinking they have become machine learning experts. Until they face real open-ended projects and fail miserably 😂
7/3/22, 4:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: What has Zion been typing for 10 years
7/3/22, 4:26 PM - +234 904 894 6475: 🤣🤣🤣
7/3/22, 4:27 PM - +234 904 894 6475: After 6 months, they will realise they are still not data scientists. Everybody will eat breakfast 😂
7/3/22, 4:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: The class will end by telling them to participate in hackathons and various PET projects 🤧.
7/3/22, 4:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Don't be a prophet of doom 😩

7/3/22, 4:28 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Ahhh yes. Kaggle. Another big mistake 😂🤣😂
7/3/22, 4:28 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Until the real world hit you😅
7/3/22, 4:29 PM - +234 810 878 6913: No loud am
7/3/22, 4:29 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Just alittle to compliment shiny.
7/3/22, 4:29 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They'll be fine in the real world jare
7/3/22, 4:30 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Courses are just supposed to teach people how to think and solve problems. It's like going to school.

So projects should also involve things that aren't taught in class, so they can learn how to do Independent research, use a scratch pad to work out a million thought process (that will work on the 1000th try) and sift through answers on Stackoverflow
7/3/22, 4:31 PM - +234 803 420 2314: When you use errors='coerce', it would force rows that may give the error to become NaT
7/3/22, 4:32 PM - +234 803 420 2314: Just make the column with date a series and convert it to a datetime
7/3/22, 4:44 PM - S+N Ayoade: That option is not available here..

Are you talking about power query ?
7/3/22, 4:44 PM - S+N Ayoade: @2348108522573 SnowFlake now works..

but what's the difference between Schema and Database 🥹
7/3/22, 4:47 PM - S+N Ayoade: <Media omitted>
7/3/22, 4:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: db is database 😂 that host your source loaded data 

Schema is how the data are organized in the db.
7/3/22, 4:52 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I used this... made sense.

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/
7/3/22, 4:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 🙏🙏
7/3/22, 4:55 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Schema is where all ur database(s) you are working with are ,which were either created or imported from other sources , in different formats, mostly relational.(Csv, excel, l SQL text, etc )

It shows you the fields names and, data types and possibly indicate which has a key and the type..


The database is usually the tabular representation of all your datasets, in rows and columns ( I .e for relational DB)
7/3/22, 5:01 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I just remembered one technique I used to use back in the day for classification problems. Using scikit-learn's predict_proba to return predicted probabilities. I had no idea it was a dangerously naive approach that only worked well for logistic regression and a few others.

It turns out that when you use it in most other classification tasks, the predicted probability distribution is only approximated and hardly conforms with the expected probability distribution. A better approach is to calibrate the probability distribution using Platt scaling (or for large datasets, isotonic regression). More recently, I discovered another powerful approach with conformal predictions. I'm surprised how these techniques are hardly covered in courses and even the top books in the field.

For machine learning in particular, a really good understanding of the underlying statistical or probabilistic aspects of one's workflow is invaluable. Otherwise, one may not understand why there's a certain results or know what other things can be done to improve them.

Another thing that's very useful in data is communication and collaboration. There are things you can't just figure out on your own.
7/3/22, 5:08 PM - +234 706 439 6712: ?
7/3/22, 5:10 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Who has noticed LinkedIn added a "laughter" icon?
7/3/22, 5:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: E never dey my own
7/3/22, 5:11 PM - +234 706 439 6712: They finally did?.
Saw a poll ,on that
7/3/22, 5:13 PM - +234 904 894 6475: People have been talking about it. I probably need to update my app, but I haven't noticed it on web.
7/3/22, 5:23 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Calculus is pretty sweet, perhaps one of the most profound discoveries in mathematics

As its applications cut across different fields. Likes of optimization, Disease Control, model selection and choosing lines of best fits,  forensic science, e.t.c.
7/3/22, 5:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: We weren’t taught to appreciate the application of it honestly.
7/3/22, 5:26 PM - +234 706 439 6712: When u enter the deeper rooms and coven of mathematics, where the real deal and the serious guys play, you would realize it's not for children..

Certain levels of mathematical sophistication, creative, innovative, and cleaver thinking would be required..
7/3/22, 5:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So we were forced to just pass grade. 

It was when I started doing ML I was seeing some application of some stuffs
7/3/22, 5:26 PM - +234 706 439 6712: It was all "memory game " na.


But real understanding is far from it.
7/3/22, 5:28 PM - +234 706 439 6712: It's left for you to school yourself n if you are lucky you got a good mentor, den he /she would u on the path of ' righteousness '
7/3/22, 5:29 PM - +234 706 439 6712: *put
7/3/22, 5:30 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yes o😁..
7/3/22, 5:42 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I have. It's about a week + now.
7/3/22, 6:03 PM - +234 706 499 0746: I quite agree. 

No disrespect though, those who taught us, how many of them knows the application of these courses?

They can't give what they don't have.
7/3/22, 7:59 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Schemas are logical containers for your database tables. Just as folders are logical containers for the files on your computer.

"Logical" means there are no strict rules to follow, you have to use your expertise and common sense. 

I hope I didn't complicate this.

7/4/22, 9:31 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You act like big mummy 😍

Can’t forget my 1st at Deloitte and I wanted to take a leave to attend DSN boot camp. 

The way you gave me advice was like big mummy talking to her little boy 😂
7/4/22, 9:32 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And it was very helpful

Have you thought of using data to automate sweet messages or emails to your crush
7/4/22, 9:56 AM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤔
7/4/22, 9:56 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yup...
7/4/22, 9:59 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I have scheduled messages to people severally, me that use to forget things 🤣

But then I do in-app scheduling. Telegram has this, Message apps usually have this.
WhatsApp has some apps for this sha.

I am still hoping there would be a WhatsApp API free for this.

Emails, I no too get wàhálà.

7/4/22, 10:17 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: OT 

If you want the experienced DE to come out give a range for the pay
7/4/22, 10:21 AM - +234 909 248 3462: 😂
7/4/22, 10:22 AM - +234 806 457 9841: I have got no idea of the salary range for data engineers in sterling.I will only get to forward CV to my boss and if contacted,you can ask about the salary budgeted for the role.

I greet you boss.
7/4/22, 10:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Make sense. 


Experienced DE just scarce make I no lie
7/4/22, 10:23 AM - +234 905 555 4527: I think you should ask for a range at least. 

That is what will motivate people to send their CV and look forward to going through all the exhausting recruitment stages.
7/4/22, 10:23 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 👌
7/4/22, 10:24 AM - +234 905 555 4527: Especially for a role that is extremely scarce.
7/4/22, 10:26 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂🤣
7/4/22, 10:28 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Extremely scarce.
7/4/22, 10:30 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I believe good BI Developer or DBA or good DA with strong SQL/Python skills should be able to transition to good DE 


So any can share their CVs
7/4/22, 10:49 AM - +234 708 145 1890: I think so too.
7/4/22, 10:49 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Depending on the environment and what stack they use.

Banking is surely enterprise so you can be sure it's not MDS 🥴😅

7/4/22, 12:21 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I think cyber security will always be needed as tech becomes adopted more and more.
7/4/22, 12:22 PM - +234 703 806 5681: This web 3.0 still never make sense to me yet, esp since crypto, NFT and Metaverse's still vibes and inshalla

7/4/22, 12:42 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I learned they are launching one of their branches here in Nigeria .abi dey Av already.

7/4/22, 12:43 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Oh...i see.  Cool
7/4/22, 12:43 PM - +234 706 439 6712: D dia Recruiting in advance, is that?
7/4/22, 12:44 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Yeah. Dev roles mostly
7/4/22, 12:44 PM - +234 706 439 6712: That's really great.
7/4/22, 12:46 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Despite our messy economy. These tech Giants are still investing in Nigeria and building their branches all around.
7/4/22, 12:49 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They're not doing it to help the economy.

Sales is important to them. Nigerians buy stuff.

If our payment options are limited or non-existent, we'll stop buying.

So just bring the market to us instead.
7/4/22, 12:49 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They will pay tax though and charge us VAT 🤧
7/4/22, 12:50 PM - +234 706 439 6712: See sense...
7/4/22, 12:53 PM - +234 706 439 6712: We are heavily capitalists....n they are capitalizing on that
7/4/22, 12:55 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Equation balanced, or should I say, equation skewed to their favor 

🧐
7/4/22, 12:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I still get recommendations slots oo
7/4/22, 12:58 PM - +234 816 484 7452: They finally recognize how good Nigerians are and how it is cheaper to get them like their Indian counterparts 🤣😂

Continue to do what you are doing and monetize it well. 

Lot of people are ignorance about personal finance including professionals funnily. I see some questions on MA and I’m like omooo. People need plenty personal finance education o. 

Making money is one, building a system that maximize that money for wealth creation is another 🥶🥶

Sign up for @2347038065681 tutoring and it’s very affordable o to learn how to properly manage your money well and play the long term game of wealth creation. 


T for Tenks

7/4/22, 4:09 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Thanks for the publicity 😄

What's MA?

https://moneywithonyeka.carrd.co

It's always weekends so it doesn't affect your work.
7/4/22, 4:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I just recently discovered personal finance isn’t automatically learnt. I do assume that professionals will sure know about it but I was wrong. 

And I think the writer of Pyschology of Money also confirmed that too that many folks know how to make money and even earn well but don’t know much about personal finance for wealth management
7/4/22, 4:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Money Africa. 


I haven’t checked this year at all, I say let me just read and get any update omoooo questions I was seeing from top professionals amazed me
7/4/22, 4:14 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Add to that the fact that many people are living in denial of how bad their finances is.
7/4/22, 4:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯
7/4/22, 4:14 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Did a session for Deloitte last month. The amount of follow up I've gotten eh 😂
7/4/22, 4:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And the knowledge that atleast another money will drop month end
7/4/22, 4:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Chai 😂
7/4/22, 4:18 PM - +234 703 806 5681: <Media omitted>
7/4/22, 4:19 PM - +234 703 806 5681: You can book for your friends and family members too.
7/4/22, 4:21 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The earlier one learn it the better. 

And it’s very easy for Tech folks to fall into that trap of denial of how bad their finances funnily and I think a video I posted sometimes ago confirmed that too
7/4/22, 4:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I have left the denial building o. All I  had to do was ask myself how long I had worked for and how much I had saved or invested 🥲
7/4/22, 4:22 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Oya I dey wait you. Don't overthink it.
7/4/22, 4:23 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What’s my % for referrals 😂
7/4/22, 4:23 PM - +234 708 145 1890: https://linktr.ee/moneywithonyeka

Saved you the stress guys.
7/4/22, 4:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Honestly 

Another school of thought will say I will learn and read about it ? Well, sure you definitely can learn but it will take a while trust me to get the ropes, so you probably would rather lean on an expert advise and also continue your Due Diligence (DD) and learning.
7/4/22, 4:25 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Group knowledge sessions are great, but 1:1 coaching really brings the issues down to your doorstep.

I've had clients go from being excited at the first call, to sober by the next.

Why?

Because they suddenly realise where they've let the ball drop.

In 1:1 sessions, we will home in on your priorities and how your money can work for you each day to meet those priorities.


And we have a 3 months option if you want a lot of hand holding and time to build discipline.

Either way, I over deliver. My bill should really be higher 😂
7/4/22, 4:25 PM - +234 703 806 5681: And you get a detailed report you can use as a working document.
7/4/22, 4:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: When I hear adult losing millions on a lost investment. I wonder haaaaa

Don’t they know how to be strategic with those things? While put your life savings on a particular asset class and not even know there’s something called Diversification
7/4/22, 4:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Or invest today and borrow money to meet a crucial need tomorrow.
7/4/22, 4:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Likeeeeeee
7/4/22, 4:27 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Some people think they need MBAs, but the real issue is career misalignment tbh. So you'll spend money on something that isn't important yet.
7/4/22, 4:27 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Anyway, sha come and work with me 😉

Small investment with lifetime value.
7/4/22, 4:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That last part very spot on. 

Learnt it in Millionaires next door book.

7/4/22, 4:38 PM - +234 816 042 7544: I'm trying to preserve my mental health atm boss.

7/5/22, 7:57 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Good read actually 

Irrespective of the PIP culture at Amazon and the hybrid arrangement of going to the office once in a while.
7/5/22, 7:57 AM - +234 816 484 7452: It is a win win for anyone who gets in, because you would have JAPA and spent at least 2 years if not 4 in Amazon
7/5/22, 7:58 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Besides if you already have the Big Tech Experience, you can easily get a senior role which is more blood Money or cash 😌
7/5/22, 7:59 AM - +234 816 484 7452: In summary, if you ask me.
I would go into this with a 100% risk.

I will drop every damn tool I am learning and focus on my DSA and start LeetCoding like mad.. Reach out to guys who already work at Amazon for recommendations and tips💯

Besides, it is time to start using the Slack group for DSA. And book Kenny , Opaino and the likes for mock interviews or they should preamp you up ahead.
7/5/22, 8:03 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Also go on twitter and find dedicated study groups. 

You can find some of this by going through the comment section or asking in the comment section too.
7/5/22, 8:04 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Ladies in the house can follow AdoraHack slack group for DSA prep or message Oluwalolope Hope on LinkedIn of MS for SheCode Africa DSA group

7/5/22, 8:14 AM - +234 905 555 4527: I am a student but a student that graduated. 
Can I still apply 😖
7/5/22, 8:18 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Word of caution ⚠️ 

It’s for Software Developers, so don’t be distracted if you don’t have requisite skill sets. Not all opportunities are for you 😊, so continue to grind and build competence one is definitely coming for the Data folks. It’s obvious Nigeria is a pool of talent and opportunities will certainly meet the preparedness one day. 

I just wanted to call that out before someone that’s still trying to build Data competence or something get distracted and adopt the fire brigade approach to start learning DSA. 

Well, sure you can include DSA in your learning roadmap. I believe it’s important. 

T for Tenks.
7/5/22, 8:19 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Not easily 😅
7/5/22, 8:19 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂🤣

That’s true oo 
I never thought of the new guys oo
7/5/22, 8:20 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Even Mid guys sef.
7/5/22, 8:20 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I was looking at it from guys who are already in a reasonable level in the data thing . Guys who are extremely comfortable with Python
7/5/22, 8:20 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Because I believe if your Python is strong, you go survive normal SDE role

7/5/22, 8:21 AM - +234 802 825 9007: That’s not true! It’s a different learning curve especially backend
7/5/22, 8:21 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This isn’t true oo
7/5/22, 8:21 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Exactly.
7/5/22, 8:21 AM - +234 816 484 7452: You know that in big tech, there’s this part of training in internal tools when you come onboard
7/5/22, 8:22 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Besides no matter how Beast level you were before, when you come in, you go still learn
7/5/22, 8:22 AM - +234 816 484 7452: They already have programs in place for that, speaking from experience
7/5/22, 8:23 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Even though, if you’re extremely good with python without SDE experience it’d be a difficult transition tbh, moreover now gunning for SDE2
7/5/22, 8:23 AM - +234 816 484 7452: And since it is an hiring event, you may not necessarily know the team you would be joining  till after everything is done
7/5/22, 8:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: At MS, I know you can ask for a particular team based on your interests
7/5/22, 8:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: But it will be hard without SDE experience sha 

I personally will struggle even with my Python knowledge for Data because I don’t have the experience. No doubt if they give me the time I go learn am
7/5/22, 8:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: But it is not guaranteed you would get it sha
7/5/22, 8:25 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Give me money and the time, I go learn anything to do the job 😂
7/5/22, 8:25 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Yes the thing is you need various knowledge of other stuff before entering. Say for example you know Kafka very well but Amazon uses another internal tool your knowledge of the internal working of Kafka will give you leverage to grasp the new tool since you have knowledge of internal workings
7/5/22, 8:25 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Struggling is in the initial stages sha

After 3 months, you go deliver
7/5/22, 8:26 AM - +234 802 825 9007: I don see python code for my life from Senior Guys and I ask myself is this really python? Did I even know python at all? Cos what? Crazy piece of code bro
7/5/22, 8:26 AM - +234 816 484 7452: The reason I am saying this is because, I have seen guys who are purely Python Devs survive in more crazy roles after getting into big tech
7/5/22, 8:27 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Internal tools is also one of the disadvantage of working in those big companies, it’d be very hard to fit into other startups if you’ve left there cos you’d have to go learn some tools again
7/5/22, 8:27 AM - +234 816 484 7452: And everywhere you go, there’s always a Nigerian community there that you can leverage on
7/5/22, 8:27 AM - +234 816 484 7452: True

That’s why I was even telling Ope why I was going over airflow and some external open source tools again when free
7/5/22, 8:27 AM - +234 802 825 9007: It’s not doubt but the chances are not entirely in your favour
7/5/22, 8:28 AM - +234 802 825 9007: 💯💯💯
7/5/22, 8:28 AM - +234 816 484 7452: SAPA and the money is enough motivation if you ask me
7/5/22, 8:29 AM - +234 816 484 7452: And the Japa effect too
7/5/22, 8:29 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Hmmm it’s not that straightforward but I get you
7/5/22, 8:29 AM - +234 704 649 8585: ❤️
7/5/22, 8:29 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What @2348028259007 is saying is that it will be obvious you don’t have SDE experience even if you try scale through the DSA. 

Your chances are very slim almost zero because we have bad guys with SDE experience and who would also be learning DSA to scale through, so why will they give you without the experience the chance?

Which is why I would have advice Data folks to just stay focused 😂

Na turn by turn. Our turn is coming. 

Maybe something to start adding to learning roadmap is DSA so as to be prepared for it when they come because certainly other companies are definitely coming with Amazon interest in Nigeria. 

So guys continue to build and grind.
7/5/22, 8:32 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Not to be a bearer of bad news but if you’ve not been studying DSA casually before, your chances are almost zero you’d get in, cos people that get into Amazon and big tech company take years to study DSA before they enter. One month is too short to study to enter. But I’d advice people to try it out to get the FAANG interview experience, it’d give you a lot of exposure to be honest. And you’d be motivated to take DSA very serious.
7/5/22, 8:32 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Tbh you have nothing to lose to give it a try
7/5/22, 8:32 AM - +234 816 484 7452: But Data folks already have some SDE experience in a way especially DE guys and ML guys.

Model deployment and all.
7/5/22, 8:32 AM - +234 816 484 7452: If you are a risk taker like me.

Eyin guys me
Make una shoot
7/5/22, 8:33 AM - +234 816 484 7452: You never know till you try sha 💪
7/5/22, 8:33 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯 

I’ve read couple of post on this tools. Very easy to become stale in other startup and companies if yo stay too long in Big Tech because of their proprietary internal tools.
7/5/22, 8:34 AM - +234 816 484 7452: people like @2347033167142 @2348146690593 should be shooting for this thing
7/5/22, 8:34 AM - +234 802 825 9007: I’m my honest opinion there are a lot to gain if you try. You get the experience, the exposure and in fact might get the job
7/5/22, 8:34 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You are actually correct not a bearer of bad news 😂. 

DSA can’t be learnt with fire brigade approach. Learn 3/6months learning.
7/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Just trying to be realistic as possible
7/5/22, 8:35 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: One guy said he did 10hrs of practice for 3 month🥶🥶🥶

I say Kuku kill me
7/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 😂🤣😂
7/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 802 825 9007: If you want to go, just have the mindset of let me go and enjoy myself
7/5/22, 8:35 AM - +234 907 510 4857: Have you tried Dropbox and Terabox?
7/5/22, 8:36 AM - +234 816 484 7452: You people are not being Optimistic like me in this thing z😅
7/5/22, 8:36 AM - +234 802 825 9007: It’s possible though if he no get work but it’s crazy
7/5/22, 8:36 AM - +234 802 825 9007: It’s not about being optimistic but bring realistic
7/5/22, 8:36 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Here.
7/5/22, 8:36 AM - +234 802 825 9007: *being
7/5/22, 8:37 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Even me sef wey Dey big tech still Dey try do DSA every day because I know it will be the bed rock of my next movement
7/5/22, 8:37 AM - +234 802 825 9007: I can drop ton of Amazon questions here and I bet you if you don’t know graph, linkedlist and dp problems very well particularly graphs and Trie, person go Lana in flying colors. Just fact!
7/5/22, 8:38 AM - +234 816 484 7452: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 8:38 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: This guy 

Say na Lana in flying colors 😂😂😂
7/5/22, 8:39 AM - +234 816 484 7452: If you are looking at big tech and you think it is just Python, SQL and Viz tool. 

You no go enter big tech ooo

Let me too start being realistic 🤣😂
7/5/22, 8:39 AM - +234 802 825 9007: DSA is very important tbh
7/5/22, 8:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Well, that’s debatable though. 

Depend on the role you are coming in and level.
7/5/22, 8:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I have friends who are in Big Tech and don’t know jack of DSA
7/5/22, 8:40 AM - +234 802 825 9007: And even at my current work place I use Graphs a lot!!!!
7/5/22, 8:40 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Do you mean to tell them to spend years doing the normal data before securing big tech
7/5/22, 8:41 AM - +234 816 484 7452: This message was deleted
7/5/22, 8:41 AM - +234 816 484 7452: If you want to secure big tech at below 25 - 27, then make DSA one of the love of your life 😅
7/5/22, 8:41 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I have 2 folk that entered from Harvard MBA with no DSA and are Managers of Data and Operation analytics respectively.
7/5/22, 8:41 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So yeah, it depends.
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - +234 802 825 9007: You don’t use DSA most of the time in Big Tech. Where DSA comes into play is when you’re dealing with a lot of scalability issue and you have to do things efficiently
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Now you are talking 😂
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Sir you said managers and are above 30 sir
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - +234 802 825 9007: School matters a lot!!!!!!
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - +234 802 825 9007: It’s the school as well.
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - +234 802 825 9007: They don’t care you age o dem go serve you DSA
7/5/22, 8:42 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I just dey say exception dey 😂😂
7/5/22, 8:43 AM - +234 816 484 7452: How many people fit enter Harvard MBA
7/5/22, 8:43 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
7/5/22, 8:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Anyone can.
7/5/22, 8:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You put in the work you sure can.
7/5/22, 8:43 AM - +234 816 484 7452: How many people can afford it too
7/5/22, 8:43 AM - +234 802 825 9007: My mentor before going to Google was almost getting his PhD in Cameroon baba gats do DSA even for senior role now baba be staff engineer for Google
7/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly my point too

You put in the DSA work too, you can enter Big tech
7/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Major Key
7/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I have seen this manifest in the lives of a lot of my friends
7/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Exactly no one is saying you can’t but in 1 month? That’s too much information overload
7/5/22, 8:44 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 8:44 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Can you get into Harvard MBA in one month
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 802 825 9007: Especially if you’re not conversant with it before
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly oo
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 802 825 9007: How na??? No now
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na jazz 😂
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 802 825 9007: As in
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly my point too
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 909 880 8992: I concur
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - +234 816 484 7452: The koko is that Harvard MBA requires money and experience
7/5/22, 8:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Which validate what Kenny is saying. 

Play the long term game.
7/5/22, 8:46 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Big tech requires passionate learning without money
7/5/22, 8:46 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So anyone that hasn’t been doing DSA before should forget this recruitment
7/5/22, 8:46 AM - +234 802 825 9007: This is the major key. If you put in the work consistently there’s nothing you won’t achieve

7/5/22, 8:47 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly 
Feel the pressure of what it is like to interview with Big tech
7/5/22, 8:47 AM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂

Even LBS gan takes solid prep.
7/5/22, 8:48 AM - +234 802 825 9007: All those 10hours of DSA a day na whining. This thing is a marathon not a sprint. If you know you want to apply to somewhere say Google next year na now you suppose start to Dey prepare. Be solving 3 questions everyday consistently till next year. Consistency is key tbh. And na where most people dey miss am.
7/5/22, 8:49 AM - +234 802 825 9007: DSA is pattern recognition to be honest
7/5/22, 8:49 AM - +234 816 484 7452: ✅✅

Good morning boss
7/5/22, 12:03 PM - +234 803 353 6901: I'm battling with reading stacked Area Chart
7/5/22, 12:05 PM - +234 818 415 3106: @2348065935396  @2348130891194 how far
7/5/22, 12:07 PM - +234 818 415 3106: But lowkey chief you don google
7/5/22, 12:23 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Still confused 🥺🥺
7/5/22, 12:25 PM - +234 818 415 3106: I get let our ogas come and explain cus i no sabi explain
7/5/22, 12:25 PM - +234 708 145 1890: What exactly are you trying to do with it?
7/5/22, 12:25 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I am not sure I get your question.
7/5/22, 12:28 PM - +234 803 353 6901: *The chart has date with hierarchy and I need to get month and year using drill up and down*
7/5/22, 12:51 PM - +234 905 937 1240: Make a date hierarchy instead, so that you will be able to drill down
7/5/22, 12:51 PM - +234 905 937 1240: It will enable the drill down for you automatically
7/5/22, 12:53 PM - +234 907 510 4857: Add the year and month to your filter then you can enable drilldown
7/5/22, 12:55 PM - +234 803 353 6901: The drill down is displaying it month, Qtr, year and day
7/5/22, 12:55 PM - +234 803 353 6901: So when I click on the drill down button I have them display in levels
7/5/22, 12:56 PM - +234 803 353 6901: The problem is how do I get Month and year for a particular thing
7/5/22, 12:56 PM - +234 803 353 6901: It's a trend analysis
7/5/22, 12:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohhh... Ehn...en
7/5/22, 12:58 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Change it from Date Hierarchy to just Date.

If it's spans a data period, it will show just date and month.
7/5/22, 12:58 PM - +234 708 145 1890: you want to be specific, you can create your month and year column and use that.
7/5/22, 12:58 PM - +234 708 145 1890: But I think this should work fine.
7/5/22, 1:01 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Neetcode.io is a great tool for crash learning

7/5/22, 1:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: UIPath?
7/5/22, 1:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, I am trying to learn for some tasks ahead.

I want to know if there's anyone interested in learning too.
7/5/22, 1:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Python RPA and Robocorp and TagUI
7/5/22, 1:57 PM - +234 816 484 7452: ?
7/5/22, 2:00 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🌚

I dropped Robocorp, I am thinking of doing GUI RPA for start.

My people no go allow me put python on servers.
7/5/22, 2:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No be everything be Python 😂😂

Be calming down.
7/5/22, 2:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Them no go even allow you.
7/5/22, 2:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can explore UIPath
7/5/22, 2:02 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Python is best to me oo
7/5/22, 2:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I learnt it briefly last year
7/5/22, 2:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Because I know UIPATH might require some form of payment at some point
7/5/22, 2:03 PM - +234 708 145 1890: It looks straight forward.
I wanted to try Power Automate RPA, but license cost no go allow me.
7/5/22, 2:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: When you can use python and then airflow the script or use from for the script or task scheduler on windows
7/5/22, 2:04 PM - +234 816 484 7452: CRON*
7/5/22, 2:04 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What of people with little technical know how. 

This guy if you develop a product Shey you go consider non technical people like this 😂😂😂
7/5/22, 2:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Definitely but the backend go be standard 

Non technical people just need to use the front and that’s all
7/5/22, 2:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
7/5/22, 2:05 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Exactly. 

Low/No code is what business people need. They don’t need to know so much to get value from their stuff, and that’s where UIPath and co comes in.
7/5/22, 2:08 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No doubt Python/Airflow combo for Automation no UI tool can beat it.

7/5/22, 2:26 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Startups will soon start hiring interns like crazy.

Like they say, you won’t know the value of what you have till you lose it
7/5/22, 2:30 PM - +234 708 145 1890: This is wild!

Relocation Winter is here!
7/5/22, 2:31 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Massively..
7/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 909 880 8992: This should serve as a lesson to the tech ecosystem in the country both startups and big companies don’t build don’t solely rely on one engineer 

Recently a friend got an offer in Amazon as a frontend Dev he’s leaving the country next month and his current company doesn’t have a backup and they have a lot of pending projects to deliver
7/5/22, 2:36 PM - S+N Ayoade: 💀💀💀💀💀
7/5/22, 2:36 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Omoooo... They better employ like 5 interns to understudy till he will leave.

7/5/22, 9:06 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Good evening bosses, Please how best do you handle two datasets each containing 3.9million rows but have similar number of columns. Using power query in power bi is too slow. This is my first time dealing with such amount of data.
7/5/22, 9:09 PM - +234 803 353 6901: 😭
7/5/22, 9:10 PM - +234 703 387 7349: have you tried  puting them in a database then do a direct query instead
7/5/22, 9:11 PM - +234 803 353 6901: This is choking

7/5/22, 9:19 PM - +234 806 457 9841: Json format?
7/5/22, 9:19 PM - +234 706 439 6712: U don't u use python or R
7/5/22, 9:19 PM - +234 806 457 9841: You should be talking about using mongoDB if it is in JSON
7/5/22, 9:21 PM - +234 703 344 8466: yes, four columns two in text, the other two encapsulating multiple columns in json format. I parsed the json in power query but it is too slow.
7/5/22, 9:21 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Too little time to learn any of it for the project.
7/5/22, 9:31 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They're a bit more straightforward than you'd imagine.

On your local?
7/5/22, 9:34 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Yes
7/5/22, 9:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Na pet project ?
7/5/22, 9:34 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Like not production? So you just want to join both tables and Viz?
7/5/22, 9:35 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Yeah, exactly
7/5/22, 9:38 PM - S+N Ayoade: Why not try cloud ?

The trails period should get you what you need
7/5/22, 9:39 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You go manage Power BI like that niyen o. 

Or explore @2347033877349  advice by ingesting the data to a db, you can quickly setup a BigQuery db or anyone and do the join and transformation there before tapping the output to Power BI
7/5/22, 9:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: With the volume of data you can’t push transformation to the BI layer it’s not optimum, you have to do that upstream. 

You don’t need anything apart from SQL. 

Bigquery or other db have functions for working with JSON blob
7/5/22, 9:41 PM - +234 703 344 8466: I tried using SQL server import tool but keep getting errors, I will try out big query as well.
7/5/22, 9:41 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: What’s the error you are having?
7/5/22, 9:42 PM - +234 703 344 8466: No wonder SQL is still relevant.
7/5/22, 9:42 PM - +234 703 344 8466: let me revert
7/5/22, 9:44 PM - +234 703 344 8466: <Media omitted>
7/5/22, 9:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Another option use SSIS ingest the data since it’s in your local.
7/5/22, 9:47 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: SSIS can connect to a local directory and load to a db maybe the direct import is having issue due to the volume. I’m not sure
7/5/22, 9:47 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Alright, let me try that as well. Thank you so much for your time 🙏🏾
7/5/22, 9:57 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Issues like this come up especially when you start to have over a million rows in PowerBI. I have worked with 10 million before. However, I did the following:
* Remove unwanted columns
* reduce cardinality of your date time column by splitting date and time
* remove columns with high cardinality
* Limit data within visuals as much as possible by using date filters. This will ensure that in PowerBi service, you are not getting memory errors.
* Avoid complex measures

The above will ensure your data model is small enough for you to publish and for your report to run faster.
However, It is important to note that except it is completely necessary, it is better to limit what is coming into PowerBi. Do complex transformation and basic aggregation SQL first.
7/5/22, 9:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
7/5/22, 9:59 PM - +234 818 047 2075: *in SQL first
7/5/22, 9:59 PM - +234 806 593 5396: 💯
7/5/22, 10:00 PM - +234 703 344 8466: Wow.. 🫡🫡🫡 No date column in the tables. I would do away with other unnecessary columns though. Thank you
7/5/22, 10:02 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Check columns for high cardinality and find ways to reduce that. PowerBi is good at compressing data except high cardinality data (many distinct values). That's usually where performance issues can come up when you have many rows
7/5/22, 10:02 PM - +234 818 047 2075: You can share a snippet of the data if it is not sensitive

- She will need to also ensure that the right data type are applied to all the needed column. 

- VertiPaq Analyzer in DAX Studio will help in running some tabular statistics and understand which column is consuming more memories. She can then decide if those columns are needed or not.
7/5/22, 10:09 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Select all the column and select auto detect data type from the transform section...

Good evening

Please, I need a Data Analyst, with background in Accounting 

More like 0-3 years of experience, combined

Do you have any matching profile
7/5/22, 10:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I suspect the pay might be around 150k-200k for a start

But depending on performance it should rise fast
7/5/22, 10:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Like up to 300k by the end of 1st year
7/5/22, 10:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And depending on negotiations, it might be more
7/5/22, 10:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Remote work, mostly
7/5/22, 10:15 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Architects should also prep on system design, very important. Even the SDE role, I suspect there will be a system design component in the interviews. FAANGs take it seriously especially for mid-level to senior positions.
7/5/22, 10:15 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Anyone interested with Finance/Accounting background?
7/5/22, 10:17 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I think this is possible given there are other rounds. One may not have done well on DSA but if the performance was unquestionably good on other rounds, there's a very strong chance of getting the role.
7/5/22, 10:26 PM - +234 803 245 4064: Can I DM?
7/5/22, 10:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Got Acc background?

7/6/22, 11:10 AM - S+N Ayoade: How ?
7/6/22, 11:16 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Lauren Balik has really been on the neck of MDS. Hers is more from vendetta compared to others that are educational who share insights on where MDS get it wrong 😂. 

She’s really gunning for destroying MDS guys driving it 😂. 

No doubt like I said there’s lot of impending issues if MDS not properly managed and well thought out but doesn’t 💯 eliminate or mean it doesn’t provide value like Lauren and some others preach. 

The weird thing is some of them preach end of MDS and say welcome to a new tool (market their own eg Coalesce which Lauren herself is recommending, Narrator.ai tool, castle or so by the so called Post MDS preacher founder 😂). 

It’s really an interesting time in the data ecosystem. The important thing is to understand specific data use case for each organization and the best tool that fit into it.
7/6/22, 11:16 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I just follow the conversation and thoughts and catch cruise while learning in the process too 😂
7/6/22, 11:18 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Though they did Lauren Balik strong thing sha that I think wasn’t right. Na that vex she dey use come upon all tools in the MDS stack leveraging on her experience and thought leadership 😂😂

I was just wondering how the founders of the tools will feel 😂
7/6/22, 11:20 AM - +234 703 845 5619: <Media omitted>
7/6/22, 11:21 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: She’s been mischievous with this image she shared though and the argument she posed. 

I saw the post but I dey play middleman and not supporting anyone 😂😂
7/6/22, 11:22 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I wanted to comment, but I say make I rest so it won’t look like I dey support one side 😂 

Make them continue their fights
7/6/22, 11:23 AM - S+N Ayoade: Thanks 

Will I be able to use it to complete the fundamental course ?
7/6/22, 11:24 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Like @2347038455619 said. It’s free forever for 1 seat.

7/6/22, 11:44 AM - +234 703 845 5619: I feel like it's more a marketing gimmicks... Because in real world application MDS is not as chaotic as the image says (except in few cases). I think people need to continue preaching how MDS has improved their data intelligence process and less of following prevalent media but then prevalent media will still prevail in decision making.😅

I personally do not think Post MDS will fly, even if it does it won't be as it is preached. But then if it does, Post MDS will still be like MDS because more products will still be created along these lines. 

And with the abundance of tools in MDS, more and more consulting experts like Data Cult and Co will be contracted for needs assessment and recommendation as what tools fit a particular business. 

I also saw the Airbyte critic, Critics are good as it helps them improve on their products but then it paint's an image of a completely bad tool... but then no tool is entirely bad.
7/6/22, 11:45 AM - S+N Ayoade: 🤝
7/6/22, 11:51 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Nothing in this world should be this complex when you're not trying to prove a scientific theory abeg
7/6/22, 11:51 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿

I love that take which is very true. Looking at the Post MDS submission truly will definitely mimics MDS with new tool evolution.  I like the submission of *Chad Sanderson* which truly explain a major challenge with MDS which is possibility of Data swamp if modeling not taking seriously and the JOIN Problem. 

She really murdered Airbyte in that post which isn’t completely true 😅😅. I’m sure you use Airbyte and I built the stack previously on Airbyte. Definitely like you mentioned there’s always room for improvement but doesn’t mean the tool is terrible like Lauren posed. 

Anyways like Benn Stancil said “More chaos more opportunities and demand for talented folks and more money 💰 “ 

I just don’t like the way they are going about the marketing by totally condemning a stack to sell yours.
7/6/22, 11:51 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The author was been mischievous and May played into it with that image 😀😂
7/6/22, 11:52 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *many

7/6/22, 11:57 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I understand position of anger sha. They wanted to run her street that level of “if you don’t roll with us we don’t know you, you have to chill with the big boys”. So because she didn’t chill with the big boys they evicted her from the community 🥶🥶.  

She’s now out to murder everyone in that space. She’s really a force on her own because she dey shake the space for real and she no dey tire 😂😂😂. For 2 months consecutively she was on their case before she started have fans support her that joined the death of MDS crusade.
7/6/22, 11:57 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Make we dey enjoy the cruise dey go 😂

I will look for it and share.
7/6/22, 12:00 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Thank sir 🥹
7/6/22, 12:03 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Summary of the gist before I share; Locally Optimistic a US vibrant data community, the major brains behind the MDS are the drivers of the community. They usually hold meetup frequently.  In March they scheduled to hold a meetup, Laurel  wasn’t aware because she was part also had like an hangout for her investors and folks too within same period. 

Local Optimistics folks reach out to her to cancel kinda🥶🥶 as per our event has been announced and we are the big boys and won’t make sense to have conflicting event 😂 (well na me dey put sugar for the gist ).  She declined that she has also planned the hangout and made announcement on LinkedIn. Her declining was where the wahala start from 😂
7/6/22, 12:09 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: She don delete the full gist o. I guess they begged her to take it down 🥶. I don search tire I no see for substack and all

7/6/22, 2:19 PM - S+N Ayoade: You saw it too bah..
7/6/22, 2:28 PM - S+N Ayoade: Always test a tool before taking into production db
7/6/22, 2:28 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Tbh what is most important is how an organisation gets value from data. The MDS tries to simplify that process. The MDS may not be the final promised land but it is better than where we are coming from. The chaos in the data space is a good thing because it points to gaps which still need to be improved upon even in the MDS. At the end of the day the data team must deliver value if the team wants to keep their jobs. So whether MDS o or LDS, or LSA just deliver value. That is the main thing.
7/6/22, 2:40 PM - +234 818 047 2075: One question I am getting asked often by Execs these days is how my projects are either adding to the top line or bottom line. They don't even know the tool stack. I am now having to think through how to track value either from a revenue generation or cost reduction/efficiency perspective. At the end of the day this is what matters. MDS helps to speed up the time to value and in some cases increases value cause it makes some things easier. But you must deliver that value to be relevant one way or the other.
7/6/22, 3:01 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Totally agree 💯💯
Optimised solutions are great but senior execs want to see value, and most times the value-drivers, especially on the near-term, are not the highly optimised solutions.
7/6/22, 3:30 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿

Time to value generation and initially increased value is actually the strength of what MDS pitch its tenth on. You can literally spin up a whole Data infrastructure that generate value in little time and minimal technical resource. 

No doubt technical debts may pile up in future if not done well but the temporal quick wins and value matter to Senior execs in the interim.  Just as @2349048946475  pointed out that most times the value-drivers may not necessary be highly optimized which I believe will be an ongoing process. 

The koko as you mentioned boss @2348180472075 is VALUE!!!

I guess it’s more job for Consulting firms like ours to help clients determine the best stack to opt-in for per time whether MDS/LDS or hybrid.  

@2347038065681 you asked this question one time about what will be the fact of Data Consulting focused company if all company build in-house competence? It’s obvious there will continue to be more chaos 😂😂 and they will need expert opinion

7/6/22, 5:00 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Good evening everyone,
Please how can I filter off NULL values in my data frame in R?

Is used the is.null() function to check for NULLs but it returned false only for me to find out later that there are NULLs in the dataset.
7/6/22, 5:01 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... is.na()?
7/6/22, 5:01 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I used this to but it is returning false
7/6/22, 5:02 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I am trying to group by a column and counting the number of times the distinct data occurs in that column
7/6/22, 5:02 PM - +234 803 884 6009: That was when I realized there are NULL values
7/6/22, 5:04 PM - +234 809 183 1446: is.na() works most of the time.. have you checked the data type for the 'NULL' values?
7/6/22, 5:04 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly...
7/6/22, 5:04 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Yes
It says there are no NULLS
7/6/22, 5:04 PM - +234 803 884 6009: 0 means false right?
7/6/22, 5:04 PM - +234 708 145 1890: What are the characteristics of those columns that are supposedly NULL
7/6/22, 5:05 PM - +234 809 183 1446: There was a conversation here on this null value a while ago. 😅
7/6/22, 5:05 PM - +234 809 183 1446: The NULL might be a character or sth.
7/6/22, 5:06 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, NULL can be "NULL"
7/6/22, 5:06 PM - +234 708 145 1890: It can even be " "
7/6/22, 5:06 PM - +234 803 884 6009: It’s a character column
7/6/22, 5:07 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Let me check for this
7/6/22, 5:07 PM - +234 809 183 1446: And you have your target null value as 'NULL' right?
7/6/22, 5:08 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Without the quotes
7/6/22, 5:08 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Yea,
7/6/22, 5:08 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Just filter on that column where it's == 'NULL'
7/6/22, 5:09 PM - +234 708 145 1890: There you go, seems its not NULL
7/6/22, 5:09 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Or this too.
7/6/22, 5:09 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I just filtered using “NULL”
7/6/22, 5:09 PM - +234 803 884 6009: And it’s gone
7/6/22, 5:10 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I was using NULL without the quotes
7/6/22, 5:10 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🥲

7/6/22, 5:29 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Incase of next time, use the df.nunique() to get a sense of every value in that column, making it easier for you to know it's "Null" not Null
7/6/22, 5:30 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Tidy verse?
7/6/22, 5:30 PM - +234 803 884 6009: Okay

7/6/22, 5:31 PM - +234 809 183 1446: You can just use unique(df$column_name) or df %>% distinct (column_name)
7/6/22, 5:31 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Its fine boss.
7/6/22, 5:31 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Aha

7/6/22, 5:32 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Funny how Tidyverse is sweet but most of the functions that come to my head first is Base R.

😂
7/6/22, 5:33 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Really??
7/6/22, 5:33 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yes, maybe because I have written R codes in a while now.
7/6/22, 5:33 PM - +234 809 183 1446: I think of base R when I'm trying to compare speed or simplicity.
7/6/22, 5:34 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Bosses no dey code R, na why 🥲
7/6/22, 5:35 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂

7/6/22, 5:36 PM - +234 812 091 9501: How?

7/6/22, 5:36 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Depending on the size.

7/6/22, 5:37 PM - +234 803 884 6009: But will this be really efficient for a dataset of over 5m?
7/6/22, 5:38 PM - +234 812 331 2626: 🤣
7/6/22, 5:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Same here. I never really think of tidyverse, but using pipes just makes life easy abeg.
It's not the easiest thing to explain to newbies sha. So I stick to base R. It's simple and straight forward to use.
7/6/22, 5:39 PM - +234 809 183 1446: hmm, Not really.

For large datasets, I think data.table might handle it. So, there should be a function to handle unique values or you move it to spark using the sparkylr package.
7/6/22, 5:40 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Funny how the first thing I think about when I have to deal with data is Tidyverse
7/6/22, 5:40 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I see…
I am not really familiar with the sparklylr package
7/6/22, 5:40 PM - +234 803 884 6009: I am a newbie in R
7/6/22, 5:40 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Even if I don't know the function to use.. There is this assurance and confidence that Tidyverse will get it done
7/6/22, 5:40 PM - +234 708 145 1890: That's How we learn things 😊🤭

It's usually a problem that makes you start the journey.

7/6/22, 5:41 PM - +234 809 183 1446: I started learning tidyverse 1 month after getting familiar to R.. I hardly knew any base R function... Til I met @2347033167142

7/6/22, 5:42 PM - +234 708 145 1890: We got too comfotable using Base R that year. Than Tidyverse came along.

7/6/22, 5:47 PM - +234 812 216 8133: 23mins+ later
7/6/22, 5:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: There was a caught 😂😂😂😂
7/6/22, 5:48 PM - +234 818 047 2075: He had no plans to and even now that he has done it, he still did it wrongly
7/6/22, 5:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes. 

He pretended like he didn’t know 😂. Laurel came over his soul.
7/6/22, 5:48 PM - +234 703 806 5681: This lady is problematic sha 😂. She even took a screenshot
7/6/22, 5:49 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 😂😂 she came for war
7/6/22, 5:49 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly.
7/6/22, 5:49 PM - +234 708 145 1890: She would be a badass lawyer 😂
7/6/22, 5:49 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Lol 😂
7/6/22, 5:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: you need to follow her 😂😂😂

She is an amazing Data thought leader. She no send anybody 😂😂😂
7/6/22, 5:51 PM - +234 904 894 6475: He told the lady "you are quick" 😂
7/6/22, 5:53 PM - +234 812 091 9501: That's where mastery comes in.. What makes you a solid R user is not that you have worked with all R packages.. There are currently over 13k packages.

It's that you can pick a new package.. Read the documentation and get your work done
7/6/22, 5:53 PM - +234 812 216 8133: That was quick😂
7/6/22, 5:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/6/22, 5:53 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I usually tell people that is what makes the difference between a newbie R user and an experienced R user
7/6/22, 5:54 PM - +234 812 216 8133: At what point do you feel you have mastered a library or language? When you Google less to solve a problem?
7/6/22, 5:54 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Never underestimate the power of documentation.

I love the help() (python), ?? (for) function a lot. Can put you out of misery quickly.
7/6/22, 5:55 PM - +234 812 091 9501: The important thing is that you know what you are googling
7/6/22, 5:55 PM - +234 812 091 9501: You know how to use the Google or stack overflow solutions to fit your problem
7/6/22, 5:56 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Exactly! I also love watching meetings/videos where people just display what you can do with their packages.
7/6/22, 5:56 PM - +234 812 091 9501: 🤝🏾
7/6/22, 5:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: This tooo....
7/6/22, 5:57 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Do well to send such meetings here 🙏🏾

I seem to be a R lone ranger 😂

I hardly join meetups except Matt's trainings
7/6/22, 5:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Matt Dancho?
7/6/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Yeah

He does some free webinars
7/6/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 216 8133: I'm asking because of some Interviews requires you to code live without googling. How do you solve that since we solve our day to day problem relying on Google?
7/6/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 091 9501: I have not done such interviews
7/6/22, 5:58 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I heard sometimes with pseudocode you still pass.
7/6/22, 5:58 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Ah!, join R salt lake Users... That's one of the coolest R user groups I've seen. I think Julia Silge heads it.
7/6/22, 5:58 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Maybe people that have done such can give opinions
7/6/22, 5:59 PM - +234 812 091 9501: On LinkedIn or Twitter
7/6/22, 5:59 PM - +234 812 216 8133: For real? I heard you must code out a working code o and explain your logic whilst doing so
7/6/22, 5:59 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Nuh, lemme fetch their meetup
7/6/22, 6:00 PM - +234 809 183 1446: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/slc-rug/
7/6/22, 6:00 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Ok
7/6/22, 6:01 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Thanks 🤝🏾
7/6/22, 6:01 PM - +234 904 894 6475: It can be difficult to generalise what mastery of a language or library is. It means different things to different people. For me, one way I know I've mastered a library is when I've gotten well abreast of different alternative techniques to tackle a specific problem and I can justify why I'm choosing one over the others.
7/6/22, 6:01 PM - +234 809 183 1446: The one I did recently, I was allowed to use stack overflow tho.. but just using the help() function in R was enough for me.
7/6/22, 6:02 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Thank you boss
7/6/22, 6:02 PM - +234 809 183 1446: David Robinson hasn't been releasing new contents but there is this website that properly documented his work.

7/6/22, 6:11 PM - +234 818 047 2075: I would argue the opposite sef. Knowing what to Google can point to some form of mastery 😁. For example I may not know all the complexities of regex but knowing that regex in Python can solve a particular problem comes with experience and some form of mastery. Just my thought.
7/6/22, 6:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I use google more than anything 😅😅
7/6/22, 6:12 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 💯
7/6/22, 6:13 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Some have said if Stackoverflow crashes 90% of tech people will lose their jobs 😂. Including your experienced big tech engineers o. It may be an exaggeration but there is some merit to it.
7/6/22, 6:13 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It was offline one time this year 😂😂
7/6/22, 6:14 PM - +234 703 806 5681: They need to add ability to Google as a vita skill in the data space
7/6/22, 6:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂😂😂
7/6/22, 6:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Googling the right thing 😂
7/6/22, 6:14 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Googling is now a good skill to have on your CV o
7/6/22, 6:16 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Sometimes i see Googling as a skill on the linkedin profiles of some Big Tech engineers
7/6/22, 6:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: It is important o. It is the difference between senior devs and junior devs 😂
7/6/22, 6:22 PM - +234 812 091 9501: Nice point of view
7/6/22, 6:22 PM - +234 812 091 9501: No truer words
7/6/22, 6:23 PM - +234 812 091 9501: The exact point I was making
7/6/22, 6:32 PM - +234 802 289 0905: I do
7/6/22, 7:12 PM - S+N Ayoade: Who has access connect here pls
7/6/22, 7:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: 🤣🤣🤣
7/6/22, 7:13 PM - S+N Ayoade: Transferred money to a wrong account and now customer support said I should goan get court order before I can get a reversal 🥹
7/6/22, 7:15 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Sir?
7/6/22, 7:18 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Not really mastery, you can know that something can solve your problem if you have a fundamental understanding of how it works but might not know how to apply it due to the complexity of the problem.
7/6/22, 7:18 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Was it my account?
7/6/22, 7:19 PM - +234 703 316 7142: My body dey find money

7/6/22, 10:03 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Debit cards are now Instant
7/6/22, 10:03 PM - +234 703 316 7142: For Dorm

Pls how can I go about it 
T for thanks
7/6/22, 10:40 PM - +234 906 092 6282: You can search the UNICHAR codes for those two icons or should I say characters
7/6/22, 10:41 PM - +234 906 092 6282: https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTips/unicode-symbols.html#emoticons
7/6/22, 10:41 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Check this link out
7/6/22, 10:47 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Instead of the icon I should insert the icon number?
7/6/22, 10:47 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yep
7/6/22, 10:48 PM - +234 906 092 6282: UNICHAR (the number)
7/6/22, 10:48 PM - +234 703 952 6987: I tried it 

It's returning the number
7/6/22, 10:50 PM - +234 906 092 6282: I mean search for the number that stands for green tick and the number that stands for red cross mark.
Something like UNICHAR (288890)
7/6/22, 10:53 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Thank you so much
7/6/22, 10:54 PM - +234 906 092 6282: You're welcome

7/7/22, 8:17 AM - +234 703 786 9165: I want to share my Tableau report with a couple of client but don't want to use Tableau Public because of the sensitivity of the data and also don't want to buy licenses for each of the clients.

Is there any way to share the interactive report securely for free? 😭
7/7/22, 8:35 AM - +234 708 675 3621: Upload to tableau public, change the visibility to private
7/7/22, 8:36 AM - +234 708 675 3621: Download your report share the twbx file
7/7/22, 8:36 AM - +234 708 675 3621: Delete from public when done
7/7/22, 8:49 AM - +234 703 786 9165: Then the client will need to have Tableau desktop and also can access the underlying data, I believe. 

The same data is being sold to multiple clients. Basically, the data is the value.
7/7/22, 8:49 AM - +234 909 431 5803: Windows Key + .
That would bring up emojis and you can insert directly like text.
7/7/22, 8:57 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Thanks will watch. I like the idea

7/7/22, 9:21 AM - +234 708 675 3621: You can send the twbx and the data source you use to your clients now
7/7/22, 9:21 AM - +234 708 675 3621: You wanted free version
7/7/22, 9:21 AM - +234 708 675 3621: When the have the data source they can just plug it to their free version of tableau
7/7/22, 9:21 AM - +234 708 675 3621: Easy peasy lemon squeezy
7/7/22, 9:46 AM - S+N Ayoade: Create an extract of the data because you can’t upload to public without that.

Set visibility on dashboard to off and give link to your respective clients.

If they don’t need access to the data, there’s no need for them to have desktop or tableau account
7/7/22, 10:25 AM - +234 703 786 9165: Thanks!
7/7/22, 10:27 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Welcome gee anytime

7/7/22, 10:50 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Pls does anyone know if scraping Linkedin data is legal. I am seeing very conflicting info online.
7/7/22, 10:53 AM - +234 806 457 9841: Good morning everyone. Has anyone analysed data stored using mongoDB with Powerbi before? I am trying to connect mongoDB atlas with Powerbi but don't know how to go about it using the connection string
7/7/22, 10:55 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Also please does anyone have experience on data sharing and regulations around this
7/7/22, 10:55 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: LinkedIn doesn’t allow it initially and state that it’s legal. However, of recent I think they lost a law suit filed to block companies from scraping their data.  Court ruled it that it’s legal. 

I was following the gist one time. Let me look for it.
7/7/22, 10:57 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Yes I saw this. Infact that happened April but I saw another place where this year Linkedin said it is not legal and they are suing another company
7/7/22, 10:57 AM - S+N Ayoade: 😍😍😍


Guess I can finally complete my LinkedIn Activity Dashboard 😌
7/7/22, 10:57 AM - S+N Ayoade: 😂😂😂😂
7/7/22, 10:58 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Make LinkedIn rest jare 😂😂😂😂
7/7/22, 10:59 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They probably will lose that too. I think illegal will be in context if the data is used for unethical stuff.
7/7/22, 11:00 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Ok thanks.
7/7/22, 11:38 AM - S+N Ayoade: Is that a yes to go ahead and scrape ?

7/7/22, 3:30 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Pls I need help with this. Thank you 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
7/7/22, 3:32 PM - +234 812 216 8133: I most times replace with the mode but check the impact of this versus deleting those empty cells on your analysis. To avoid a bad result

7/7/22, 3:38 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Good afternoon boss....

Yes please.
7/7/22, 3:53 PM - +234 703 678 8365: I prefer deleting to reduce bias towards the most occurring category.
7/7/22, 3:54 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay.
7/7/22, 3:54 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Pls, more comments 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
7/7/22, 4:07 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Check the impact of deleting against the other variables in the dataset that will be lost.
7/7/22, 4:15 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Depends on what type of data we are talking about, I'm working on a project rn whereby dropping 1row is a crime cos each row is believed to carry awesome information. In this case, and also since it's a categorical column, you can create a new category for missing data and try that.
7/7/22, 4:17 PM - +234 703 786 9165: I must say that ML is an iterative process and there's no one size fits all, so I'd advise you remove the column and check the impact on your model, replace with a constant value and check, basically try everything you can get your hands on and check the impact and go with the one with the least negative or best impact.

I forgot my password and I needed to login to pg4admin and when I could not, I had to reset password.

After that, it carried me to the main page and when I tried to click on PostgreSQL. It said
'Please enter the password for the user 'postgres' to connect the server. - "PostgreSQL 14"

Please help me.

What do you suggest I do?
Thank you

Browsing the Internet, I found it is something that happens but you will have to do some modifying to be able to access it back and I don't understand how
7/7/22, 8:26 PM - +234 708 145 1890: When this happened to me,

I had created a .pgpass file which had the password. So I just went back to check.

7/7/22, 11:00 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Hello everyone,

Please is any one here specialised in object oriented analysis and design?
7/7/22, 11:10 PM - +234 805 365 5849: Hello everyone 
Given a table with 3 columns in sql: Id, start and end. How can you return rows which over lap. eg start 1 end 7 overlaps with start 4 end 9. Note: start and end are integers, and the overlapping rows may occur anywhere, not necessarily consecutively.
7/7/22, 11:14 PM - +234 703 316 7142: So how will the final result look like?
7/7/22, 11:16 PM - +234 805 365 5849: For rows that overlap, return the row with a bigger Id. Eg if row 2 and row 10 overlap, return row 10.
7/7/22, 11:17 PM - +234 808 589 7009: Can you show an example of the sample table with like 5 records in excel and expected result(table)
7/7/22, 11:19 PM - +234 703 316 7142: For this kind of problem, you will have to be clear about constraints, assumptions e.t.c
7/7/22, 11:19 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Something like this will also help
7/7/22, 11:20 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Cos row 2 in your illustration can overlap with many rows and not just a row
7/7/22, 11:21 PM - +234 802 755 7589: Microsoft people. 

I need shortcuts to learning Azure ML. Like I need to know it like now now. 

Kindly share your best resources for a beginner. 

Thank you.

PS. I know about aka.ms/ML-essentials
7/7/22, 11:22 PM - +234 805 365 5849: Yes. and the row with the bigger Id should be returned.
7/7/22, 11:22 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Baba wants to learn Azure ML in less than 30 minutes
7/7/22, 11:22 PM - +234 802 755 7589: I no go mind rn
7/7/22, 11:23 PM - +234 703 316 7142: It's not clear still. What's the problem you are trying to solve?
7/7/22, 11:25 PM - +234 816 484 7452: It is not legal

They have securities in place to block you but you can use third party api to scrape like proxycurl 

It is fre for some time and paid afterwards

7/7/22, 11:40 PM - +234 805 365 5849: My interpretation of the question, was: find out trips that went on at the same time, and return the trip that started last ( bigger ID ). I don’t know if this is sufficient information.
7/7/22, 11:44 PM - +234 703 316 7142: From what I can deduce from this, there is no way you can write the usual SQL query without a loop to solve this.
7/7/22, 11:47 PM - +234 805 365 5849: Same I thought. With a double for loop.

Want to replicate want i did in PostgreSQL to MySQL 🥹

Daddy ati Mummy DEs in the house
7/8/22, 5:07 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Hello, I’m assuming both the MySQL and Airflow instances are on your local machine ?
7/8/22, 5:08 AM - S+N Ayoade: Yes
7/8/22, 5:11 AM - +234 811 792 7254: …and you’re connecting to mysql using mysql connector in Python and then calling that method using PythonOperator on Airflow ?
7/8/22, 5:11 AM - S+N Ayoade: I’m using the MySQL operator of Airflow just as I did with Postgres
7/8/22, 5:12 AM - S+N Ayoade: from airflow.providers.mysql.operators.mysql import MySqlOperator
7/8/22, 5:13 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Could you try creating a .py file to connect to mysql using mysql connector and then reading that file using PythonOperator to call that file from Airflow?
7/8/22, 5:14 AM - +234 811 792 7254: You can first do a test within Python to guarantee successful connection to your MySQL instance
7/8/22, 5:14 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Once that’s successful, let Airflow connect to that file using PythonOperator
7/8/22, 5:14 AM - S+N Ayoade: https://www.projectpro.io/recipes/use-mysqloperator-airflow-dag#mcetoc_1g4ilqejoh

This dude did it but somehow village people dey hold my MySQL for neck 😂
7/8/22, 5:14 AM - +234 811 792 7254: If Airflow doesn’t have the connector library and you have docker, just create a Dockerfile for your airflow instance and install the connector
7/8/22, 5:15 AM - S+N Ayoade: Oga mi sir, I never sabi reach this level.

Na milk I still dey take for this tech 😂
7/8/22, 5:16 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Let me read this up. I normally just do all my connections within Python like this:
mysql connector for MySQL
cx_Oracle for Oracle
psycopg2 for PostGres
pyodbc for SQL
7/8/22, 5:16 AM - +234 811 792 7254: We can do a test first and then we schedule a call to fix?
7/8/22, 5:16 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Let’s test by connecting through Python
7/8/22, 5:16 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Let’s ignore Airflow for now
7/8/22, 5:16 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Is that fine ?
7/8/22, 5:17 AM - S+N Ayoade: Thanks so much 🤝
7/8/22, 5:17 AM - S+N Ayoade: Yea..
7/8/22, 5:17 AM - +234 811 792 7254: Okay, cool

7/8/22, 6:29 AM - +234 807 491 6916: Good morning Fam, please I need recommendations for workspaces with good ambience around Yaba and it’s environs.

PS: Can one just go to CcHub at Yaba and work from there?
Last time I was there I was partnering with an organization.
7/8/22, 6:37 AM - +234 818 484 5784: Please were you able to solve this, because I also get the same error error message when using MySQL image on Docker.
7/8/22, 6:46 AM - +234 703 350 4764: Check DSN
7/8/22, 6:57 AM - +234 806 261 4811: You can check Nest hub at Alagomeji (it’s about 3k daily with WiFi) or CIBN library in Sabo (10k/year) but very conducive
7/8/22, 6:58 AM - +48 791 169 055: TheBunker just before Alagomeji

7/8/22, 9:23 AM - +234 809 183 1446: Good morning data wizards.. I trying to work on an automation task and I don't have an idea how where to start or tools to look into.

Basically this is the concept. The tool would record some steps the developer takes to test his/her app (mostly a web app) and when next the developer wants to take those steps again, he/she would just hit 'play'.

Dunno if I'm making sense but that's the idea.. I'd appreciate any recommendation. Thanks 🤲🏼
7/8/22, 9:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Seems like you have a flow here

Is it Desktop Automation or Browser Automation or ETL automation
7/8/22, 9:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: ??
7/8/22, 9:25 AM - +234 809 183 1446: Browser automation
7/8/22, 9:26 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Check out Robocorp framework or normal Python RPA framework by robocorp or check out TagUI rpa or the python variant
7/8/22, 9:27 AM - +234 816 484 7452: RPA generally should be able to handle it for you
7/8/22, 9:27 AM - +234 809 183 1446: Alright, thanks boss. I'd check those 🙏🏼
7/8/22, 9:45 AM - +234 909 130 5248: What is the question you have??
7/8/22, 9:51 AM - +234 708 145 1890: @2348164847452 and these python based frameworks sha.

🌚

@2348091831446 is you want things very easy with GUI based RPA, try UiPath, Power Automate or Automation Anywhere 😊
7/8/22, 9:51 AM - +234 703 845 5619: I don't know... Asking for someone... Can I share your contact to the fellow?
7/8/22, 9:55 AM - +234 809 183 1446: Thanks ☺️

I'm not going to be using the tool tho, the dev team just wants me to setup something that would make their web applications testing easier. Testing is more like making a set of clicks on the web app just to make sure that they didn't break anything or so.  For now, those procedures are done manually.

7/8/22, 12:41 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I think she's making a case against adding more tools.

In the end you have to go down to the unit economics and make a case or whether the value of MDS is making any further addition to the "insights" generated for the company.
7/8/22, 12:41 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Hence, more credit for providers.
7/8/22, 12:43 PM - +234 703 845 5619: I think She's saying the people who benefit from the MDS pipeline and infrastructure are the cloud providers of those services and not the business that patronises them. 

She is coming from a standpoint that an infrastructure or pipeline (in this case MDS) does not automatically translate into data insights and business value. 

She also claims that the widespread belief that getting the MDS will automatically bring insights is only half truth and not all the truth.
7/8/22, 12:46 PM - +234 703 845 5619: IMO, she is also saying half truth because using a traditional infrastructure does not also automatically mean business insights and everyone will agree that the tools/stack do not equal great insights for the business but the brains utilizing these skills. 

In terms of providers making money, Microsoft and IbM enjoyed monopoly in the infrastructure space for a long time and she didn't complain that businesses was not getting insights from their MS stack. 

she's just making a case that's not valid in my opinion.
7/8/22, 12:46 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Lol 😂

7/8/22, 12:48 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Who does she have a vendetta against?
7/8/22, 12:48 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The community that tried to bully her
7/8/22, 12:49 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: No doubt she’s right about the MDS space been run like a cult 😂😂😂
7/8/22, 12:50 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Anyone that want to develop another tool in the MDS must roll with them because of funding and the likes driven most times by Amplify VCs and other folks.
7/8/22, 12:50 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Why though?
7/8/22, 12:50 PM - +234 703 806 5681: And why were they trying to bully her?
7/8/22, 12:51 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Oh I see
7/8/22, 12:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: They didn’t bully her actually. But she felt they did 😂. 

Based on the gist I shared last time. She didn’t cancel her own  meetup, so *Emilie* - Lady that murdered DS last year at coalesce when we will all shouting death of DS 😂, she’s a popular person and a thought leader in the MDS space, she reached out to her and all about the event and encourage to maybe postpone or something since it conflicted with LO meetup. 

Laurel sha told her no and all. In all honesty I saw the conversation because she posted it on LinkedIn though deleted now, I didn’t see any iota of her been abusive or condescending. She was then reported that she’s threatening someone in the community na so them evict her from dbt channel 🥶🥶
7/8/22, 12:58 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: She was angry sha and felt bullied by the MDS community and was ready to also show that she sef she’s a force to reckon with and she really is. So every week she dey come upon the soul of all tools in MDS 😂😂😂

Of recent she wrote a post about the flaw of dbt (which were true) but the MDS folks didn’t say anything. So someone in the MDS space now wrote a similar post on areas dbt should improve on which got recognized and mentioned. 

VP of Brooklyn Data made a post on LinkedIn referencing that post;

7/8/22, 1:18 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Omo 🤯. But on a serious note. No tool is perfect and not suite of tools is also. You will always have wins and losses when it comes to the data game. Some of the losses will be human related and not tool related. What we need to do is to find out if many companies are having more losses than wins, if they are then MDS is probably broken (dead is such a strong word which only applies if no company is getting value).

Insightful post about changing jobs.
7/8/22, 1:38 PM - +234 703 845 5619: then we need to ask... are the losses due to tools or humans? 

How do we measure this? Remember that business value and success for a business from data is relative and subjective. 

If we say that because some people have losses from MDS then MDS is dead, then we have to also say that losses from traditional stack or Post MDS tools are due to the tools as well and therefore everything is dead, lolz😅😅...

But then, we know everything is alive, half alive or so...lolz
7/8/22, 1:42 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Thank you for this. Tbh, it is actually very difficult to determine cause of the complexities as you highlighted. So for someone to say MDS is dead, the person needs to come with all the facts and data. It is fine to say it is broken and highlight the challenges that make it broken but saying it is dead doesn't work. Like @2348108522573  said this looks like a personal fight
7/8/22, 1:42 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: In all honesty MDS actually drive more value as against the loss that Anti-MDS preaches.
7/8/22, 1:43 PM - +234 818 047 2075: and she cannot win it

7/8/22, 1:45 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: And truly it has been hijacked subtly and that’s why I said if you want to develop any tool in the MDS space then you need to roll with the LO folks 😂😂.  I don’t think it’s a bad thing sha 😂😂
7/8/22, 1:47 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The *Her* she referred is the Amplify Partner - Sarah. Who is also another force in the Data community.
7/8/22, 1:49 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Is the JBTD article same as the one written by Emilie, if yes then she has given a biased view. I read that article last week and I found it very helpful even for my organisations' environment where we haven't moved to MDS. She just dey vex abeg. No doubt there may be marketing gimmicks but she shouldn't tell us every thing isn't useful or MDS is dead.
7/8/22, 1:53 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yes same 😂


That’s why I felt her opinion are biased from vendetta pov. 

Someone like Chad, SeatleDataguy , Joe Reis and other random engineers critic tools generally and you can learn because they educate and provide insights from their experience and not necessarily like a war.
7/8/22, 1:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: SeatleDataguy wrote an article why MDS is great and also of the opinion that some stuffs aren’t needed especially the explosion of tools ⚒️.  

Chad also acknowledged  dbt and some tools been great but also emphasized how it can turn to disaster when Data modeling isn’t done well and all. 


They should see each other in camera and settle the fight 😂, but it look like Lauren is out for war

From "data science is the next thing" to "data science is dead" and now analytics engineering is having similar push back.

The truth generally lies in the middle and data will always need to undergo certain processes. Master those as fundamentals and you can go wherever the hype is.
7/8/22, 2:24 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I think I like Lauren Balikpapan because of her doggedness and faithfulness to this fight

7/8/22, 5:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For DS - I think Kaggle still one of the best place to practice sha and learn. Then maybe after doing few Kaggles now start learning how to put code into production beyond Jupiter notebooks. 

Maybe pick 1 end to end project from Data extraction down to deployment to do.  That’s why true true I believe DS/ML isn’t for beginners unless you want to give it 2years of learning atleast
7/8/22, 5:25 PM - +234 907 739 3129: I tell you man. 

100%

7/8/22, 5:27 PM - +234 704 649 8585: I'm not even rushing into that. BI tools and SQL is okay for now. If we don blow small we go try DS
7/8/22, 5:28 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Please what kind of small business and why cloud storage?

I mean does the business really need a cloud storage solution?

This would give context on what to recommend or other solutions aside cloud solutions.
7/8/22, 5:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You may not even want to. 

DS hard 😂 

I respect una o @2349077393129  @2349038954127  @2349048946475  @2348163815935  @2348167187102 @2348039160301 and et. all

7/8/22, 5:29 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Does any of our vendors here sell those headsets with microphones? 🤲🏼
7/8/22, 5:30 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: With a robust knowledge of a Viz tool, SQL in your armory and maybe add Python when you learnt those ones well you can do wonder. 

So just pace yourself and learn by doing.
7/8/22, 5:30 PM - +234 818 362 0831: Learn by doing💯💯💯

7/8/22, 5:34 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Well ... It's not that small

But  I need a cloud storage facility where each dept can store their separate files
7/8/22, 5:42 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Okay.. Microsoft One drive, Google drive are easy options
7/8/22, 5:43 PM - +234 708 145 1890: What email do they use?

They should already have some for of storage tied to it.
7/8/22, 5:43 PM - +234 703 952 6987: It's not giving me what I want
7/8/22, 5:44 PM - +234 708 145 1890: And what's that?
7/8/22, 5:45 PM - +234 703 952 6987: With ms one drive. If you are in account dept, you can access files from let say sales dept

And that's not what I want
7/8/22, 5:45 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnn... you want each department to have their own secure file storage.
7/8/22, 5:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: But can share with other things yea?
7/8/22, 5:46 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Yes Sir
7/8/22, 5:46 PM - +234 907 510 4857: Dropbox for business
I use it and its seamless
7/8/22, 5:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Do they have their different emails?
7/8/22, 5:47 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Sharing isn't necessary

Just storage and retrieving
So that they don't necessarily need to come to the office searching for files
7/8/22, 5:47 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Yes
7/8/22, 5:47 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohkay Boss...
7/8/22, 5:47 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Google drive allows you to access only what you have been given access to tho... That may work
7/8/22, 5:48 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Then each email can be used to create their own file storage.
7/8/22, 5:48 PM - +234 703 952 6987: Okay... I will do research on this
7/8/22, 5:48 PM - +234 708 145 1890: If sales have their email (Gmail for example) then they surely have a Google drive.
7/8/22, 5:51 PM - +234 703 952 6987: What if the MD needs a file from sales, how can he get it without necessarily seeking for the sales email?
7/8/22, 5:52 PM - +234 708 145 1890: So, the MD can be granted Access to all documents before hand.
7/8/22, 5:53 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ideally, if these are business emails,
You should have Microsoft SharePoint or Google Suite.

With these two you can have an Admin and that easily share access.

But for a small business, it might too capital intensive.
7/8/22, 5:55 PM - +234 703 952 6987: I'm actually thinking of Microsoft business 365
7/8/22, 5:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: That's the way to go then.
7/8/22, 5:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Check the pricing and see if it's what you want.

You can simulate and understand O365 with a developer account.

7/8/22, 10:01 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Honestly, with the way things are evolving and dying rapidly in this data space, this is just the most reasonable thing to do.

Master a viz tool, master SQL, master either Python or R, or both. Maybe add some automation skill. With these you can function in any hands-on area in data. There are so many aspects of these skills that are highly transferrable. So, even when all sorts of "stack" come up now and then, and the need arises for you to work with new tools, you will find it relatively fast to learn. Many companies even know that having strengths in the above core skills is proof that you can easily transition to new tools.

The long and short is that many skills are ephemeral, but few skills can serve you for the long-term. Focus on the latter.

Volvo has opened their Internship in different tech areas (UX, Data Science, Software...) and they will sponsor your visa just for the period also.

You must be in an associated BSc or MSc program though.

Windows 10
7/10/22, 11:22 PM - +234 810 878 6913: That's what I'm thinking
7/10/22, 11:23 PM - +234 810 878 6913: But I have deleted most of my engineering software yesterday
7/10/22, 11:23 PM - +234 810 878 6913: So there should be space
7/10/22, 11:28 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Well , here are few recommendations 


+ compress  most ( large files  ) you don't always use.(zip dem)

+ Uninstall softwares you you don't often use 

+install duplicate file finder, run it to detect and delete all duplicates
7/10/22, 11:28 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 2.56ghz max speed or base speed?
7/10/22, 11:30 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Another addition, check the apps under *startup* in *Task Manager*. You can disable unnecessary apps from starting up when you start your 💻
7/10/22, 11:30 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Save files on a Cloud Drive.
7/10/22, 11:32 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah.. Like Google drive or 'Mega'
7/10/22, 11:32 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Dropbox and 1drive is kinda limited, for the free versions though..
7/10/22, 11:33 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Consider expanding your memory too. If you can get an SSD into your computer, it'll save you a lot of unnecessary headache.
7/10/22, 11:37 PM - +234 810 831 6393: You should consider increasing your ram as well
7/10/22, 11:38 PM - +234 818 415 3106: Just throw the laptop away and save yourself all the stress
7/10/22, 11:39 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Processor
7/10/22, 11:39 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Alright, thank you
7/10/22, 11:39 PM - +234 706 439 6712: I think the spec is fine.

Unless he's into mad 3-D animations, or AutoCAD, n the likes..

7/10/22, 11:42 PM - +234 810 831 6393: 4gb ram 🤔
7/10/22, 11:43 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Intel
7/10/22, 11:44 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Intel is fine... They have better processors
7/10/22, 11:45 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yeah. ..He can top up with 2 though .
7/10/22, 11:46 PM - +234 810 831 6393: I use 12gb though
7/10/22, 11:46 PM - +234 706 439 6712: But he should the aforementioned..



Most times it's not really  by increasing the ram size..



Proper files management is just what's needed .
7/10/22, 11:47 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Omo 


Ur na Cheif analysts na
7/10/22, 11:49 PM - +234 706 439 6712: If ur dealing with mad mega datasets,   u would need anything from 8G ram up....plus good processors 


For better performance
7/10/22, 11:56 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Is my processor okay?
7/10/22, 11:56 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Yes
7/10/22, 11:56 PM - +234 810 878 6913: So all I need is to add extra 4gb ram?
7/10/22, 11:57 PM - +234 810 878 6913: To make it 8gb?
7/10/22, 11:57 PM - +234 810 878 6913: How about the 500 hdd?
7/10/22, 11:58 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Av u done these ?
7/11/22, 3:13 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I don't know how to compress files
7/11/22, 3:44 AM - +234 705 824 3068: Go download winrar to help in file compression or something similar
7/11/22, 3:55 AM - +234 810 878 6913: I think I have that
7/11/22, 3:55 AM - +234 705 824 3068: Then use it
7/11/22, 3:55 AM - +234 810 878 6913: How?
7/11/22, 3:56 AM - +234 705 824 3068: Open it and see

7/12/22, 2:10 PM - +234 809 183 1446: I'm trying to extract the word in *bold* below

How would you rate X as being...? - SAP - *Selective*

How would you rate X as being...? - SAP - *Behind-the-times*

How would you rate X as being...? - SAP - *Forward-thinking*
7/12/22, 2:11 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Use capture groups
7/12/22, 2:11 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Capture any alphanumeric characters after SAP -
7/12/22, 2:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: So something like this will do:

"Sap - (\w+)"

"Sap - (\w{1,100})"

You can tune the max above as you wish
7/12/22, 2:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Post the result this gives and let's see if you get the desired output
7/12/22, 2:14 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Yea, i tried some similar.. the 'SAP' changes
7/12/22, 2:15 PM - +234 809 183 1446: SAP is just a company name and there a lot, so it breaks some times
7/12/22, 2:15 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Let's see what you tried
7/12/22, 2:15 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Okay, I get
7/12/22, 2:16 PM - +234 809 183 1446: \\s\\w+-?\\w*-?\\w*$
7/12/22, 2:16 PM - +234 809 183 1446: This working for now sha
7/12/22, 2:16 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Can you send a snapshot of the samples here so we know how we can handle it for you
7/12/22, 2:17 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Aiit boss
7/12/22, 2:17 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I see what you are trying to do here
7/12/22, 2:18 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I feel \w should be tuned to capture the likes - and _ as alphanumeric characters
7/12/22, 2:22 PM - +234 809 183 1446: <Media omitted>
7/12/22, 2:24 PM - +234 809 183 1446: I think there's an easier regex to do this.. cus this could break given some conditions
7/12/22, 2:27 PM - +234 809 183 1446: It didn't capture 'High Paying'
7/12/22, 2:37 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I will send you something shortly
7/12/22, 2:38 PM - +234 809 183 1446: 🙇🏽‍♂️🙇🏽‍♂️
7/12/22, 2:40 PM - +234 905 515 5864: Preuben69@gmail.com
7/12/22, 2:40 PM - +234 905 515 5864: Sure.
7/12/22, 2:47 PM - Joe: What I think might work (I run it in my head and it works, it might fail when you use a normal interpreter).

I'm assuming you can use python.

I would use python string split method. At first, I thought about splitting by hyphen then I saw that some words can have hypen

Then I realized that I don't think there's any English word (I stand to be corrected) that space will follow the hyphen back and front.

So I think if you should split with ' - ' (space hyphen space)

You should have a list 

[ Question, SAP name , Answer] 

Thinking out loud 😁
7/12/22, 2:49 PM - +234 703 316 7142: str_extract(rows, '(\\w+-?\\s?\\w*-?\\w*)$')

str_match(rows, 'McKinsey\\s-\\s(\\w+-?\\s?\\w*-?\\w*)$')[,2]
7/12/22, 2:50 PM - +234 703 316 7142: @2348091831446 , I hope this works for you? But might not work for something like this: "High Paying Job"

You might have to tune the Regex to also capture something like this
7/12/22, 2:51 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Thanks a lot!
Yea, this would work, but... it has to be in this format (R and str_extract()) cus i have to pass the regex into another function that uses str_extract() as its backend
7/12/22, 2:51 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Boss Boss

He has learnt the trade well 🤣😂
7/13/22, 8:53 AM - +234 703 806 5681: He's a very unserious person.
7/13/22, 8:53 AM - +234 816 484 7452: The relationship is not by force even after meeting her parents 🤣😂
7/13/22, 8:54 AM - +234 816 484 7452: He should just forget about coming to Nigeria sha
7/13/22, 8:55 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I can't wait to read his article on BAT sha
7/13/22, 8:57 AM - +234 810 831 6393: If Batists get hold of him 😂
7/13/22, 8:59 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly and they have the largest cartel in Nigeria via NURTW
7/13/22, 9:01 AM - +234 810 831 6393: But they can track him with Intel sha, BAT still have some network across Africa sha
7/13/22, 9:09 AM - +234 701 008 9044: Lol, but he has consistently attacked Buhari and they have not done anything, why do you think BAT can/will do anything
7/13/22, 9:12 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Because BATist are different from Buharist 🤣😂
7/13/22, 9:13 AM - +234 909 130 5248: Huh??? 😂😂😂
7/13/22, 9:15 AM - +234 810 831 6393: I tell you
7/13/22, 9:28 AM - +234 903 783 8682: The guy is only doing what he's paid for.

He should enjoy it while it lasts. Reno did worse yet today he has been abandoned.
7/13/22, 9:28 AM - +234 703 806 5681: If anything happens to him, we know BAT is involved
7/13/22, 9:30 AM - +234 813 948 5182: Paid for? 👀
7/13/22, 9:30 AM - +234 812 216 8133: You sound cocksure that he's being paid. What are you sources for this claim?
7/13/22, 9:30 AM - +234 701 008 9044: Lol, who is paying David?
7/13/22, 9:30 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Guy, help me ask o😂😂
7/13/22, 9:32 AM - +234 903 783 8682: But honestly, I'm really unhappy with how we managed to being politics into this group.

We'll only cause unnecessary tension.

Personally, I have no pvc and I believe many of us won't even vote.
7/13/22, 9:32 AM - +234 810 831 6393: BAT might not, but Batists will
7/13/22, 9:33 AM - +234 813 324 1349: He’s not paid.

Have you listened to any of his spaces on Twitter?
7/13/22, 9:34 AM - +234 816 484 7452: So it is not about bring politics into the group

Whether you like it or not, you are in Nigeria and we can only hope for a better Nigeria

We are young and know for a fact that our decisions today would speak a lot of what Nigeria will be tomorrow
7/13/22, 9:34 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Lol.

Time will tell. He should enjoy it while it lasts. 

May God spare our lives.
7/13/22, 9:36 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Continue.

You'll see the implications soon.

Politics, tribe and religion should be relegated to the background as much as possible in a heterogeneous setting.
7/13/22, 9:36 AM - +234 816 484 7452: None of this is geared towards causing unnecessary tension

Instead it is about being informed

No matter the number of lies, there would still be an atom of truth in one place.

So for the fun of it, let’s get this knowledge and information.

What you do with it is *YOUR CHOICE*
7/13/22, 9:36 AM - +234 909 130 5248: This is cap
7/13/22, 9:37 AM - +234 903 783 8682: There are already enough outlets for discussing these topics.
7/13/22, 9:38 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Besides you refer to these things as topics

Is it not still Data sir
7/13/22, 9:38 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Is Data not Information
7/13/22, 9:38 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Why don't you have a PVC?
7/13/22, 9:38 AM - +234 816 484 7452: What you do with your data is up to you

How you validate the authenticity of your data is up to you
7/13/22, 9:39 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I'll keep the reason personal.
7/13/22, 9:39 AM - +234 816 484 7452: And last time i checked this group is a *YOUNG DATA GROUP*
7/13/22, 9:39 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Lol. There's sentiment in this data.
7/13/22, 9:39 AM - +234 816 484 7452: It’s still comes down to your choice sir
7/13/22, 9:40 AM - +234 816 484 7452: What you do with it
7/13/22, 9:41 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I don’t like twitter because of the violence but I am still on the platform 

So I hereby conform to their own rules and policies even if I don’t like the violence because people do business on twitter, education and skills tips are being shared on the platform also
7/13/22, 9:41 AM - +234 903 783 8682: My own is just that we should please try to avoid bringing politics, tribe and religion into this group as much as possible.

Everyone should keep their religion, political opinions and tribal sentiments to their self or other groups as much as possible.
7/13/22, 9:42 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I think you are missing the point sir

There’s no need for tribe and religion in all this talk
7/13/22, 9:43 AM - +234 816 484 7452: We are talking about the *STATE OF OUR COUNTRY*
7/13/22, 9:43 AM - +234 816 484 7452: and you feel it is politics agenda here and there .
7/13/22, 9:44 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Whether you like it or not

What you refer to as Politics is what defines the state of our country and day to day lives.
7/13/22, 9:44 AM - +234 816 484 7452: No one is campaigning for votes here
7/13/22, 9:44 AM - +234 816 484 7452: No one is pushing one candidate over the other
7/13/22, 9:45 AM - +234 816 484 7452: We are only playing with data by sharing it
7/13/22, 9:46 AM - +234 816 484 7452: What you do with it , whether you collect it or not is your own ball game.

*But we data centric folks, we need so much of this information so we can make better inferences that will spur the right actions from us*
7/13/22, 9:47 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Be like say you dey debate team for school
7/13/22, 9:47 AM - +234 816 484 7452: You might not like it but we have found ourselves in such a situation that we live in Nigeria and need as much info/data as possible
7/13/22, 9:47 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
7/13/22, 9:48 AM - +234 706 439 6712: 👀
7/13/22, 9:49 AM - +234 903 783 8682: You know, Nigerian politics can't be more volatile than it is now.

Many people believe their tribe and/or religion is under attack in this period.

Every statement has the potential to spark tension. And every tension has the potential to escalate quickly.

I just hope you guys get my point.
7/13/22, 9:50 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Yes we get your point sir

Which is why they didn’t leave out the name *PROFESSIONALS* from the title of the group chat sir
7/13/22, 9:51 AM - +234 816 484 7452: It is expected and expedient of everyone here to act in a *PROFESSIONAL* way as possible at all times.
7/13/22, 9:51 AM - +234 816 484 7452: How a professional would handle data or information is much different from how a street-orchin would
7/13/22, 9:52 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Except you are saying a number of folks here are not qualified to be here.

I don’t expect people who are chasing career growth and *BETTER DAYS* to result to violence or act in an unwelcome manner sir
7/13/22, 9:53 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Just my own take on it all oo
7/13/22, 9:54 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Whether you like it or not, we are in the election period and this determines the life of every Nigerian irrespective of tribe or religion one way or the other.

Political data/info would always leak out this period no matter the constraints or policies put in place
7/13/22, 9:55 AM - +234 816 484 7452: We just need to live it and become better
7/13/22, 9:56 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Maybe we go do masterclass on Data leakage 🤣😂 sef
7/13/22, 9:56 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Hun…. @2349037838682 @2348164847452  this is dicey…

7/13/22, 10:50 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Halos my people 

Just catching up on the messages 

In all honesty religious and politics related convo can be dicey and can trigger unnecessary tension of We against them, so I understand @2349037838682 concerns as such as much possible candidate related conversations should be avoided 🙏. Sure we can advocate and drop information to nudge everyone to get their PVCs to exercise their franchise and whoever you choose to vote for or why we think a candidate is the savior Nigeria is expecting should be avoided.

No doubt it’s a Data centric group and also doesn’t mean we can’t have conversations outside of Data, however such conversations should be one that won’t trigger unnecessary uproar like religion, ethnicity or politics. 

Don’t forget to get your PVC

See you all at dbt meetup on Saturday 😍😍😍🤭

7/13/22, 11:01 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: General comments from CVs received. 

📌 Please as much as possible shrink your CV to 2 pages at max (1 page if possible with proper template). 

📌 For Entry level and anyone who don’t have any prior Data experience, you can create a section called *Project/Portfolio* to highlight all your personal projects. This is another reason you need a portfolio beyond taking courses. 

I see a couple of CVs and I know this folks have the skills to do the job but the CVs communicate otherwise. 

Recruiters will still refer to your resume for any role, don’t let a poor CV reduce your chances. If needed consult a professional to help you work on it if you can’t. 

Thanks.
7/13/22, 11:02 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Even if you have to pay, please do. 

Thanks.

Let’s not start it. 

I have my reservations about him too but here isn’t where to have that convo. 

Maybe on another platform we will discuss politics and all. 

T for Tenks 🤭
7/13/22, 11:14 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Love emoji?🥴
7/13/22, 11:15 AM - +234 703 160 7868: Okay...noted. I can only say for some of us the knowledge on "the topic of who he is" is limited and quite shallow
7/13/22, 11:15 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Revamps are always necessary.

Had to do one on mine this holidays sef.

Few things that helped me.

1. Use a blank sheet to chronicle your journey.

a. Career - start from year one. Forget the company, list what tasks you did and what was accomplished in each one.

b. Projects. Use the STAR method. 

c. Extracurricular eg. firm contributions. How did you use your interests and skills to help others grow.


2. Take every item in (1) and slot them under job headings.

For example, I've done work in Audit, accounting, forensic, risk management. And data projects. So I created headings for each one.


3. Do a search on job titles you're interested in and what skills and tasks are required.

a. Map your discovery to your own experiences.

b. Where are you lagging? Plan to close the gap. 


4. Transfer this to your CV. 

a. Summary (may or may not be necessary depending on the years of experience you have).

b. Skills (technical and soft skills related to the role. 

c. Experience

d. Portfolio/Projects (include links to git/medium/wherever you documented) 

e. Education 

f. Certifications and trainings 

g. Achievement


5. Items in (4) above can be rearranged to stress what's most relevant to the recruiter. 

You want to put the most important thing at the top. People don't always have time to read the world on your resume lol. 

If you're going to put a summary section (not objective), make sure you stress leadership ability (if it's a managerial or lead role) and the core areas of your expertise. 


There are no hard and fast rules to these things tbh, but cv revamps are an ongoing thing in your career. 

Keep a working documents on G-doc to take note of accomplishments and tasks so you don't forget.

7/13/22, 11:18 AM - +234 813 151 7157: Wow😶
7/13/22, 11:19 AM - +234 703 160 7868: Yes ooh.....I have rest my case Boss! We can trash that topic in another fora. In here, we keep it lean to our principal matter of data.
7/13/22, 11:22 AM - +234 813 312 7971: It will shock you😂
7/13/22, 11:23 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Seriously. It wasn't until  I started that doc on Monday that I realized how much work I'd done in my life and what I had forgotten about 😩

7/13/22, 11:24 AM - S+N Ayoade: Quite a dicey topic this morning.

But one thing that’s certain is that we shouldn’t be oblivion to our environment.

Political issues affects every aspect of our day to day activities.

Thanks @2348164847452 for reinforcing that.
7/13/22, 11:28 AM - S+N Ayoade: Lastly whether David does it for money or not, he’s damn good at what he does.

@2349037838682, I think you’re being biased with “ being paid to do what he does”.

Just like my other data centric folks have asked, where is the data to support this claim. I will leave it at that.

That’s what investigative journalism is about.

Only he and AriseTV gives Nigeria media hope that truth still exists btw.

7/13/22, 11:31 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Online builders are cool, but tbh, I've had more hits and call backs by just doing things the old fashioned and unconventional way.
7/13/22, 11:32 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I've seen crazy CVs o 😂.

Laslas just have the experience and skills recruiters want.

A friend of mine wrote his cv in narrative form.

Everytime you got rejected in the past, he revamped and changed the format.

Laslas he ended up with narrative-style. That one got him the job 🤦🏽‍♀️

One of these days @2348164847452, I'll like for us to sitdown on a round table seeping our favourite drink while we discuss the state of everything in our country from data to economy and politics. Honestly speaking these are issues folks here should be properly informed about given the available data on such topics.  Everyone be crying inflation here and there but they don't know the cause and yet they'll be acting the least bit concerned.😕
7/13/22, 11:41 AM - S+N Ayoade: So back your truth with data and don’t throw words around boss..

I don’t know how tasking it is so can’t give a range. You can use Glassdoor to have an idea then +/- the median number or lowest band.
7/13/22, 4:13 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Okay boss. Thank you

7/13/22, 4:15 PM - +234 703 316 7142: This table has records of flights from a particular location (Origin) to the other (Destination). You need to write a query that returns Origin, destination, stops, total_cost for a travel with minimum cost that requires maximum of 2 stops. If there are two location pairs with same total cost, then select the one with highest stops.

7/13/22, 4:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: ?
7/13/22, 4:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: How is it 1400 with the 2 stops Abi I dey interpret am differently
7/13/22, 4:25 PM - +234 703 316 7142: I dey reason self join with no join condition (cross join) but that will only account for max of 1 stop.
7/13/22, 4:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s a Lateral Cross join
7/13/22, 4:26 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Then doing some Lag to confirm stops
7/13/22, 4:26 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Nested SQ 

🧐
7/13/22, 4:27 PM - +234 703 316 7142: So you can go from SFO -> DFW -> JFK -> LHR

which is 200+200+1000 and it's 2 stops (DFW & JFK)

I missed that.
7/13/22, 4:32 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The 2 stops will make it tricky. 

The 1 stop shouldn’t be difficult with a cross join.
7/13/22, 4:37 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Yeah! I'm trying to wrap up my thinking to writing an innocent select query that would answer the question without me using loops.
7/13/22, 4:56 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You obviously need a Loop.

7/14/22, 2:51 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Basically, ESRI is the leading company in the geospatial (GIS) industry. They're like the Microsoft of the geospatial industry.

Did I say leading? It's more or less a monopoly. 

They have many proprietary tools and solutions. But, there's no way a company can ever be so big that they make everything by themselves. So, many of their solutions make use of open-source solutions under the hood.

The interesting part is that ESRI always tries to hide this fact from their users.

Imagine using geopandas under the hood and calling it spatially enabled DataFrames. Laughable, isn't it?
7/14/22, 3:03 PM - +234 909 431 5803: You want to group the questions into categories?
7/14/22, 3:03 PM - +234 706 942 4890: Making alot of user aware that they also rely on opensource might b bad for business
7/14/22, 3:04 PM - +234 706 942 4890: why pay for ur license when i can just go get the open source software itself.
7/14/22, 3:04 PM - +234 706 942 4890: the ArcGIS pro and latest QGIS has some similarity in Visual graphics that i noticed too
7/14/22, 3:25 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Their users idolize them. They know this and want it to remain so.
7/14/22, 3:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Those that mean they lock-in their features even though they leverage open source?
7/14/22, 3:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: How’s that possible?
7/14/22, 3:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: 😂

That one sef dey 

Spatial pandas
7/14/22, 3:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: *Does
7/14/22, 3:28 PM - +234 814 669 0593: They basically build on top of it.
7/14/22, 3:29 PM - +234 816 484 7452: They build on top of open source
7/14/22, 3:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Ooh

Gotya

Thanks @2348146690593
7/14/22, 3:29 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Oh
You have even commented 😂🤣
7/14/22, 3:30 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Make sense now. 

Is it a bad thing ni ? Why hide it from your user even as a Big company ?
7/14/22, 3:31 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Commercial products use open source libraries all the time. It is not a big deal.


The crime ESRI commits is they act like they don't.
7/14/22, 3:32 PM - +234 706 942 4890: ESRI actually tries to simplify a lot of things for its users. 

also they partner a lot of Government organisations ... who might not that u knw
7/14/22, 3:32 PM - +234 706 942 4890: so they need to sell the closed source thing
7/14/22, 3:33 PM - +234 706 942 4890: *who might not like that*
7/14/22, 3:34 PM - +234 706 942 4890: i did a training with Usaid and i realise their staff are still 2.6 version of 2014 when there is already 3.8

it was said that due to security reasons
7/14/22, 3:35 PM - +234 706 942 4890: they cant allow them use the newer versions yet
7/14/22, 3:35 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Makes me remember the movie bloodshot. The guy used open source tools as the main for a billion dollar project 
😂😂
7/14/22, 3:35 PM - +234 706 942 4890: u get
7/14/22, 3:37 PM - +234 706 942 4890: d owner fit go create backdoor entry
7/14/22, 3:37 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Anyways, there are some things that are basic. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheels. 
If ESRI don't want to use those tools, they should build theirs from ground up.
7/14/22, 3:39 PM - +234 903 783 8682: It means they give it another name and make their users think it's something they innovated.
7/14/22, 3:40 PM - +234 903 783 8682: They mostly only give the packages and modules new names.
7/14/22, 3:46 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Honestly, their tools aren't that easy to use compared to their open-source counterparts.

Maybe you're comparing their low/no code solutions to open-source coding solutions that's why you think they're easy.

For example, their story maps looks easy because it's a no code solution. The open-source alternative is to use leafletjs and maybe GeoDjango to build a webmap. So ESRI's solution is easier in this case because it's no code.

However, compare arcgis to qgis. The ease of use in QGIS is too much for arcgis.

The only good side I know about ESRI products is interoperability. The seamlessness of Arcgis desktop with arcgis online/enterprise and their mobile apps (survey123 and arcgis fieldmaps) is impressive.

That's worth paying for, if you ask me.
7/14/22, 3:47 PM - +234 706 942 4890: yes they simplify the code aspect a  lot  to no code
7/14/22, 3:48 PM - +234 706 942 4890: projection in qgis gives us more window for parameters setting than in arcgis.
7/14/22, 3:49 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Lol.

You want to kill ESRI?!

Even giants have their limits. 

Maybe (maybe oo) they can build geopandas by themselves.

But they can never build GDAL by themselves. Never ever!

And GDAL library is the root of all geodata science.

ESRI uses the common epsg code in their software. Yet they refused to call it epsg code. I think they call it authority code or something.

Very funny people.
7/14/22, 3:50 PM - +234 706 942 4890: Esri partners microsoft now ... no b say they no go fit try am e go take more time and resources and more money to spend too
7/14/22, 3:50 PM - +234 706 942 4890: thats my point
7/14/22, 3:50 PM - +234 706 942 4890: instead of going to search the code
7/14/22, 3:50 PM - +234 706 942 4890: online if u dont
7/14/22, 3:51 PM - +234 903 783 8682: True shaa.

7/14/22, 4:09 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Some companies are still yet to leave python 2.x

It's not only about security. It's also about the cost of training their staff on the new version and moving legacy code/projects to the new version.

These things cost a lot in a standard enterprise system.
7/14/22, 4:10 PM - +234 706 942 4890: yea but thats what they stated as the reason

7/15/22, 2:00 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: For building competence about a tool? Yes. But great for introducing you to a new stack or concept
7/15/22, 2:02 AM - +234 903 783 8682: It's not enough to build competence but it's a good starting point.

Is that what you meant?
7/15/22, 2:03 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah. 

My response was referencing the Reddit opinion
7/15/22, 2:04 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Actually, I want to explore DE.

And DataCamp is one of the options I'm considering.
7/15/22, 2:08 AM - S+N Ayoade: They’ve really got nice resources but I’m concerned person go dey cram code ni..


Their tableau 💀
7/15/22, 2:13 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I took some courses in their machine learning track. I can relate.

However, I think craming happens when you don't understand the concept clearly. Sometimes the instructor's explanation might not be good enough.
7/15/22, 2:17 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Thanks so much.

7/15/22, 7:52 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Even though he might be right that there are fewer aspiring data engineers,  those additional points are not it.

People know of its existence, unlike solution architects or analytical engineers, and others in that aspect. 

He is very wrong about data scientists avoiding software engineering, at least for those that want to move. Most data scientist role now has a software engineer bit embedded in their job description.  The difference between machine learning engineers and data scientists is almost non-existent. You will solve leetcode problems and algorithm problems at the recruitment stage. After getting the job, you will develop things. It will be difficult to avoid it.
7/15/22, 8:00 AM - +234 814 669 0593: And yes, the "prediction" envelope. A lot of fresh data scientists have that issue too. They believe they are coming to import models from sklearn, fit them to data, predict, and voila! Money flows in. 

If you are lucky (unlucky), you might be doing that. I know people who have been doing that well in their careers.

 However, you might be creating complicated models and pipelines and architecture that predict (or __ call __) will be a  stage in your problem.

7/15/22, 10:34 AM - +234 809 183 1446: They've done some updates on their app now.. maybe it'd change
7/15/22, 10:34 AM - +234 814 833 4339: How??
7/15/22, 10:34 AM - S+N Ayoade: Honestly, the hike in gas in the coming winter will affect everyone
7/15/22, 10:34 AM - +234 814 833 4339: Restrictions have been building before the war
7/15/22, 10:35 AM - S+N Ayoade: *of
7/15/22, 10:36 AM - +234 903 783 8682: This is more reason why we should strengthen our ties with other world powers especially China.

Our reliance on USD is too much.

US keeps wasting dollars on useless wars, printing more dollars and we at the bottom of the chain bear the brunt of their reckless acts.
7/15/22, 10:37 AM - +234 706 439 6712: And you think China would be your savior? 


🤣.


China ?
7/15/22, 10:38 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Spotify has never gone through.

Yesterday, I could get GCP credits 😩. They closed my billing account.
7/15/22, 10:38 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Things are hard globally.

You can ask your people who are in UK and US.

They really picked a wrong war. Unfortunately, Putin has said he doesn't mind if the US wants to fight till the last Ukrainian.
7/15/22, 10:38 AM - +234 903 783 8682: At least we won't be relying on only one option.
7/15/22, 10:39 AM - +234 706 439 6712: None of these world heads give a F about you or your country.

Is all business and business strategy to rule and control 


No friends , no folks. Just business
7/15/22, 10:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: They sent an email. Check.

They'll move your money to your wallet.
7/15/22, 10:39 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Make I go check am.
7/15/22, 10:39 AM - +234 703 806 5681: My Access card stopped working for payments. I switched to Zenith.
7/15/22, 10:40 AM - +234 703 806 5681: It's the bank doing it.

Pressure on the Naira.
7/15/22, 10:40 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Foes *
7/15/22, 10:40 AM - +234 703 806 5681: That's where it will drop o.
7/15/22, 10:41 AM - +234 814 833 4339: Due to CBN policies
7/15/22, 10:42 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Yes. But also because they can't keep funding the exchange.

They usually have to pay the companies and they can't source enough forex for it.
7/15/22, 10:42 AM - +234 706 439 6712: A major market crash would most likely hit, in some months time 

Worldwide.... Everyone be on guide and wise , on your finances
7/15/22, 10:44 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Stupid policies that only favors the elite class abi..

🧐
7/15/22, 10:51 AM - S+N Ayoade: I think it was obvious from the start where Joe’s interest lies
7/15/22, 10:56 AM - +234 903 783 8682: You know this Russia-Ukraine war was an eye-opener for me.

I've been reading about Russian and Eastern past and present civilization. There's a lot of good life beyond Europe and North America.

Before, I used to wonder why anyone would want to visit Russia or any Eastern country let alone decide to live there. 

The kind of media we consumed from childhood and still consume has been has skewed our perception of life while we know not.
7/15/22, 11:00 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Exactly..


We've been lied to by mainstream media, on numerous things. This dates back ages.
7/15/22, 11:03 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Imagine sending people to a suicide mission and calling them heroes.

These Ukrainians are dying daily, yet the news keeps telling us they're destroying Russian warships and killing Russian generals.

This is so effed-up.
7/15/22, 11:10 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Very true.

Sometimes, I want to pity these politicians because some of these things aren't their fault. And our media is hellbent on turning us against our leaders. They only enjoy pushing bad news.

But then, if these leaders had fixed NTA and other government agencies, we wouldn't have been in this mess.

One bad thing about being a chronic liar and cheat is that one day you'll be telling the truth and no one will want to believe.
7/15/22, 11:12 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Most the media houses works for some politicians. 


U know that right ?
7/15/22, 11:13 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Let's leave this matter sha...e don dey turn to political discussion...


U no get that strength abeg
7/15/22, 11:14 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Sure.
7/15/22, 11:14 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Politics is the biggest industry in this company (maybe even bigger than oil).
7/15/22, 11:16 AM - +234 903 783 8682: I like discussing politics. I don't just like partisan politics.

I just don't think any politician is worth losing a kobo for.
7/15/22, 11:16 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Country*
7/15/22, 11:16 AM - +234 903 783 8682: My laptop crashed yesterday.

That's why I have sma time today. 😓
7/15/22, 11:17 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Na how I go make money, Make mark, enjoy my life....n at last leave this miserable planet .dey my mind..like this.



No body is transparent or really truthful about anything....


All we do is circled our emotions/feelings and beliefs system.
7/15/22, 11:22 AM - +234 903 783 8682: Many of our political opinions are based on bias. We might not want to acknowledge it but it's the fact.

At best, the educated ones try to cosmetize our bias with grammar and vocabulary.

When our preferred candidate errs, we give excuses. When an opponent does a tenth of the same error, we want to crucify him.

Political arguments are laughable to say the least.
7/15/22, 11:23 AM - +234 706 439 6712: You are one real nigga..

Is there a distinct difference between what's referred to as modeling in PowerBI and building ERDs for databases? Are these just nuances or they're different?

But I wonder why Python is pushed more than SQL in mainstream media when SQL is mostly used in industry compared to Python for Data Analyst role.
7/17/22, 9:15 AM - +234 803 916 0301: But this is not analyst anymore... It's more of Science
7/17/22, 9:16 AM - +234 803 916 0301: For Data Analyst it's definitely SQL.... Job requirements is just off point most times
7/17/22, 9:18 AM - S+N Ayoade: Na Data Science be this na 😂 

Make una no confuse beginners like us o.

Abisola has told us what we should learn 😍
7/17/22, 9:18 AM - S+N Ayoade: SQL is not even there at all 😂
7/17/22, 9:37 AM - +234 909 130 5248: It varies across the company and business needs. SQL is still the primary tool, Python is only being pushed cos of its simplicity and friendliness
7/17/22, 10:00 AM - +234 810 878 6913: Exactly
7/17/22, 10:01 AM - +234 810 878 6913: How is Python friendly?
7/17/22, 10:05 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Even the creature its self is wicked cus ko ye mi

7/17/22, 10:58 AM - +234 708 675 3621: I'm actually looking for this too

7/17/22, 12:13 PM - +234 817 965 1769: Will you advise SS2 students to learn data analysis (EXCEL and POWER BI) or he should just start with learning Python
7/17/22, 12:14 PM - +234 701 146 5366: You can try *Quillbot*, I have used it before.
7/17/22, 12:14 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Start with Excel
7/17/22, 12:15 PM - +234 703 806 5681: EVERYBODY should start with Excel
7/17/22, 12:15 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Na naija we dey. Every company uses excel
7/17/22, 12:16 PM - +234 904 894 6475: Depends on the goal. If the goal is to teach kids programming, Python is a good start. If the goal is to get them started in data, Excel. In more powerful ways than we seem to realise, Excel can help strengthen the foundation for reasoning in data.
7/17/22, 12:17 PM - +234 706 942 4890: Yes i av quillbot but the free one doesn't do much sha.. but if I see sm1 interest won't mind buying a paid one together fr 50$ dats 25 each sha fr  a year
7/17/22, 12:18 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I should probably say if the goal is to get them started in anything analytical using computers, Excel is an excellent start.
7/17/22, 12:19 PM - +234 907 510 4857: Finally 

I’m glad we’re seeing it this way.

I’ve had so many people argue with me that you don’t need Excel for ata analysis.

They end up learning Python and sql first

How about basic excel
7/17/22, 12:19 PM - +234 817 965 1769: I actually do advocate for Excel FIRST
7/17/22, 12:21 PM - +234 817 965 1769: I am just thinking that normally in secondary school  curriculum for some private schools, they do include software/ programming though not effective. 
The student can just learn Python to strengthen his programming knowledge
7/17/22, 12:21 PM - +234 907 510 4857: Thank you for being honest
7/17/22, 12:23 PM - +234 907 510 4857: They do have programming as part of the curriculum.

If they offer computer studies

Programming is always part of the curriculum.

I had a text book in my SS1 

Trust me university students still use that because it had the basics of programming.

You learn Python, C++ and rest
7/17/22, 12:24 PM - +234 817 511 5556: 🥲 omo how does anyone say they don't need excel
7/17/22, 12:24 PM - +234 907 510 4857: I’ve seen people o

Sometimes I just sit and wonder how they want to do it.
7/17/22, 12:24 PM - +234 907 510 4857: I feel most people follow the trends instead of learning the process
7/17/22, 12:25 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Honestly because any standard data analyst course always starts with spreadsheets
7/17/22, 12:25 PM - +234 817 511 5556: They are always the foundation
7/17/22, 12:26 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Everything else builds on spreadsheets
7/17/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I have a mentee who began learning Python for data analytics. Said she couldn't understand how to tie it into corporate finance.

I told her to pause first and take the PwC data analysis course.
It's analytics foundations, excel and power bi.
7/17/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 806 5681: *power point
7/17/22, 12:27 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Exactly because Corporate Finance roles funnily always have Excel skills as a requirement
7/17/22, 12:27 PM - +234 907 510 4857: As a finance analyst

The first things she needs is actually Excel

Even CFI uses excel

7/17/22, 2:50 PM - Joe: Has anyone here setup a mongoDB replica set locally before? I'm having errors I don't understand and I don't think I'm doing anything wrong (followed a guide). Had to repair installation at one point 

2) how would you approach parsing a nested JSON with dynamic keys (some of keys has numbers that changes at the end of the string). I have a list of all the variations 

What I'm thinking 

join the keys with a delimiter to become a single string then use regex to find the full string for each key.

How would you solve this ? 🙏🏽
7/17/22, 2:52 PM - +234 703 316 7142: To Q2, won't regex work??
7/17/22, 2:52 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Happy Sunday y'all ❤️

7/17/22, 3:05 PM - Joe: The error message or JSON?
7/17/22, 3:06 PM - Jamiu Afolabi: For Qst 1... Can you send a screen grab of the error message
7/17/22, 3:07 PM - Jamiu Afolabi: For Qst 2... Regex will do the trick

7/17/22, 9:03 PM - +234 816 484 7452: He should start learning Python generally and leave data analysis for now .

He should become a beast with Python most especially on DSA to have a good shot at Big Tech early on for internships
7/17/22, 9:04 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly
7/17/22, 9:05 PM - +234 816 484 7452: But nobody will believe that I no sabi excel 😅😆
7/17/22, 9:12 PM - +234 817 965 1769: For kids though I always want them to get well grounded in programming before anything else. You can’t be teaching excel to students in primary schools

It was really a great privilege to meet the amazing beings in this community.

I can't tag everyone but the meetup is an eye opener to a lot of things. Aside learning, I am more grounded on investing in human capital.

I'm back to my city of less traffic (Ibadan) and hopefully finish my final year project then focus on becoming a proper tech bro 😂.

Make I join @2348074916916 to dey fork GitHub Repo .

Have a less traffic and riverine week to my Lagos people 

Special shoutout to the father of Naija dbt @2348108522573 and the mother @2349055554527 (no ask me how o).

7/18/22, 10:45 AM - +234 812 216 8133: You can find and replace.
7/18/22, 10:45 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Alright then.

@2348108786913, you can CONCAT "Q" to it if you want or do FORMAT
7/18/22, 10:45 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... How will that work?
7/18/22, 10:45 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Filter the Quarter columns to show only 1,2,3, and 4. 

Right click on any of the cell, replace with Q1, etc

7/18/22, 10:46 AM - +234 812 216 8133: This works too.

I trust we are doing great.

As mentioned last month, I will be holding a Master class for SQL Intermediate developers for 4 weeks (weekends) starting on the 6th of August. 

I will give out 10 scholarships out of 50 available slots to interested YDPite😅 on this platform, and this is how the selection for the scholarship will be issued:

First 10 YDPites to give accurate answers to the provided test assessment will be eligible for the scholarship. The next 40 participants will be required to pay a sum of #10k to be selected.

```Admission is based on competency```

Full details will be dropped before EoW.

In addition, there will be a 40 days daily challenge on LinkedIn for all SQL developers (Beginner-Advance) to participate in solving business question using SQL💪🏽

Cheers! 🥂

I currently use GTBank’s dollar card and it works perfect
7/18/22, 4:57 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Mastercard or Visa?
7/18/22, 4:59 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I use Zenith MasterCard. Had difficulty paying for Google storage this month. Had difficulties with some other payments as well.
7/18/22, 4:59 PM - +234 805 365 5849: Yeah. This works great. I use the UBA dollar card. Also easy to get and fund.
7/18/22, 5:00 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Hasn't bothered me actually.

I used to have my Access account on Google. But they stopped charging it months ago.

Then I switched to Zenith for about two months now and it's been working fine.
7/18/22, 5:01 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Are you using VISA or Mastercard??
7/18/22, 5:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Please confirm. 

Not sure Mastercard is going through o

7/18/22, 5:03 PM - +234 817 965 1769: Can't pay  and storage is full

All my cards didn’t work.
7/18/22, 7:14 PM - +234 816 484 7452: My God

*Someone’s Zenith* 🤲🤲
7/18/22, 7:15 PM - +234 703 786 9165: Before you can get the card, you must have carried out some heavy transactions using their platform.
7/18/22, 8:50 PM - S+N Ayoade: $5k
7/18/22, 8:52 PM - +234 816 484 7452: I can request for the card but I don't use Payoneer anymore
7/18/22, 8:53 PM - +234 809 183 1446: It's 2k
7/18/22, 8:59 PM - S+N Ayoade: $5k is to be able to send money to other Payoneer accounts
7/18/22, 9:00 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Yea, some global payment stuff.
7/18/22, 9:00 PM - +234 809 183 1446: But 2k is the requirement to get a card

7/18/22, 11:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Decent level is relative
7/18/22, 11:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: <Media omitted>
7/18/22, 11:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I think how long will be dependent on individual. How many hours can you devote daily and project worked on during those period. 

On average maybe a month or 2 with dedication since you already have knowledge of R
7/18/22, 11:34 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Ugh.
7/18/22, 11:35 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I'll do the course in R first and keep Python as a rolling plan 😪

7/18/22, 11:38 PM - Condil: There's a course by frontend mentor that introduces programmer from other language to python. Though, Django was the final project
7/18/22, 11:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I'm not looking for fun abeg 😂.

Moving the needle is more important. Was looking for a course, found it in Python only on Udemy, but DataCamp has it in R.

I wonder if DSN has kicked me out 🤭
7/18/22, 11:39 PM - +234 703 316 7142: But you don't have access to the course on Datacamp🤔
7/18/22, 11:39 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Ese jare.

Basic knowledge is what I'm after though. Just enough to self-correct and troubleshoot on SO.

7/18/22, 11:40 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I do for the next one week based on their freebie.

With my knowledge on how client billing work, I know client won’t pay immediately, most likely 30% or so at the beginning and balance at the end and some client will be chased sef before they balanced.

7/19/22, 10:48 AM - +234 803 353 6901: *NNPC Quietly Approves Petrol Pump Price Hike To ₦179/Litre*


The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has approved an upward review in the pump price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) from N165 per litre to N179 per litre, effective today (Tuesday).

NNPC in a notice to fuel marketers directed them to change the petrol price on pumps to the new price effective today. This was even as the company equally increased the ex-depot price from N148.17 to N167 per litre.

This came after weeks of petrol scarcity resurfaced across the country as fuel retailers were adopting different price bands to force unofficial deregulation attempts.

Already, majority of filling stations in Lagos have adopted different price models. While some filling stations have changed the price on their meters to reflect the current price they are selling at, others have left theirs to show the approved retail price of N165 per litre but were selling above the displayed price.

For instance, the Mobil filling station on Agidingbi sold a litre of petrol at N170 per litre on Friday and that was evidently displayed on their meters.

The development was also the same at Enyo filling station at Chisco bus stop, in Lekki, which now sells for N170 per litre, Eterna filling station at Jankade bus stop, Lekki sells at N180 per litre and Mobil Filing station, by Osapa London, Lekki now selling at N170 per litre.

7/19/22, 11:33 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: ❓

How do your data team setup multiple environments for development (dev/prod)

 Do you leverage same db different schemes or different dbs?


I’m working on something internal and I want to get other considerations and idea 

@2348164847452 @2347085316273 @2348180472075  @2348106129023 @2349048946475 @2347060577846  and all the upstream management bosses

7/19/22, 11:39 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Meltano is an alternative to Airbyte.
7/19/22, 11:39 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: If you can check out Airbyte, learning Meltano shouldn’t be difficult
7/19/22, 11:40 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Different S3 buckets here.
7/19/22, 11:42 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Different entities actually depending on the volume , access frequency etc

But if it’s a small scale environment, you can save cost by doing some partitioning
7/19/22, 11:43 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Omo we don't have test/prod for now sadly. We have just 1 environment for everything. I won't advise it sha. A better approach would be to have 2 different environments, 1 for dev and 1 for prod. To porevent having 1 point of failure
7/19/22, 11:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m referring to environment for development and production and all. That kind of thing
7/19/22, 11:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Do you get?
7/19/22, 11:43 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: S3 like?

Please explain @2347085316273
7/19/22, 11:43 AM - +234 818 047 2075: Using different schema is not bad sha but it is still 1 point of failure.
7/19/22, 11:45 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: So 1 db and you separate with different schemas
7/19/22, 11:45 AM - +234 816 484 7452: The best approach would be to spend less on Dev and spend more on Prod. so definitely different entities goes

So it has to be 2 different entities 

Why because Dev would be everybody playground and can it won’t be handling the main stuff

So if dev is like 40Gb in storage

Prod can have more with SSD reliance .
7/19/22, 11:46 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Okay. 

How do you manage access and privileges?
7/19/22, 11:46 AM - +234 816 484 7452: In our current team sef here

We get Dev , PPE and PE

PPE - Pre production 
PE - Production
7/19/22, 11:47 AM - +234 810 612 9023: Different DBs where possible
7/19/22, 11:47 AM - +234 816 484 7452: It just depends on a lot of things actually
7/19/22, 11:47 AM - +234 708 531 6273: Instead of your normal db we use S3 buckets
7/19/22, 11:47 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I would advise you list out what are those things that are important to you 

Then now use that to build up your infrastructure
7/19/22, 11:48 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Considering your Budget too
7/19/22, 11:48 AM - +234 816 484 7452: If you have the bucks
Have Dev, PPE and PE 😅
7/19/22, 11:49 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Be calming down no be Big Tech

7/19/22, 11:49 AM - +234 816 484 7452: That’s true sef

This is another route
7/19/22, 11:49 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I’m curious why? 

Any reason for that approach?
7/19/22, 11:50 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Storage is cheaper 
Compute layer will be separated and abstracted from storage
7/19/22, 11:52 AM - +234 803 702 0011: E say na correct 😂
7/19/22, 11:54 AM - +234 708 531 6273: You don't have to use an s3 bucket. Just trying to let you know that in my case our storage was an s3 bucket(DB in your case). Instead of partitioning 1, we used 1 for each environment.
7/19/22, 11:55 AM - +234 708 531 6273: The best practice is to use 1 for each environment.
7/19/22, 12:23 PM - +234 807 491 6916: Good afternoon Fam, trust our day is going great

7/19/22, 1:00 PM - +234 706 057 7846: At my previous workplace, we have different subscriptions for the Development and Production environment.

There's also a CI/CD process for deployment.

So, it's a multiple environment.

If both Dev and prod are in the same environment, I don't think that's Optimal

7/19/22, 5:40 PM - +234 708 145 1890: The major difference in options are the last two arguments.

In the reference table, G2:H6, you want to get values from the 2nd column (I.e. H2:H6)

You also want an Approximate match
7/19/22, 5:41 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Thank you sirs 🙌

7/20/22, 8:57 AM - +234 806 150 6913: LMAO
Have you tried accessing the classroom?
7/20/22, 8:57 AM - +234 706 632 1212: ☝🏽
7/20/22, 8:57 AM - Anjola: Yes
All in French!
7/20/22, 8:58 AM - +234 806 150 6913: Hmm, let me check mine and see if it can be changed in the settings
7/20/22, 8:58 AM - Anjola: Okay, please let me know because I also checked the settings as well but no difference
7/20/22, 8:59 AM - +234 806 150 6913: Hello,
are we supposed to meetup on slack or we form a WhatsApp group?
7/20/22, 9:00 AM - +234 818 415 3106: i think slack is where you ask questions
7/20/22, 9:01 AM - +234 818 415 3106: the meetup would be via zoom
7/20/22, 9:02 AM - +234 818 415 3106: you can actually form a whatsapp with friends for the sake of accountability
7/20/22, 9:04 AM - +234 706 632 1212: I think one of the slack rules is to communicate only on the slack community. Other platforms have been prohibited
7/20/22, 9:06 AM - +234 806 150 6913: <Media omitted>
7/20/22, 9:07 AM - +234 806 150 6913: Okay, this is can be sorted

Thank you so much

7/20/22, 9:08 AM - +234 818 415 3106: will they know?
7/20/22, 9:09 AM - +234 909 248 3462: For my cohort we created a WhatsApp group and it was very very helpful i will advise them to do the same
7/20/22, 9:10 AM - +234 806 150 6913: I joined the WhatsApp group for your cohort earlier on, 
that's what prompted me to ask the question
7/20/22, 9:11 AM - +234 806 150 6913: 🤝
7/20/22, 9:11 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Lol you people better form support communities for yourselves as learners
7/20/22, 9:11 AM - +234 806 150 6913: 🤝
7/20/22, 9:15 AM - +234 909 248 3462: Just create a WhatsApp group before you know the group will be flooded over time
7/20/22, 9:20 AM - +234 905 555 4527: Can we just create a slack channel?
7/20/22, 9:21 AM - +234 803 928 8326: i am almost concluding mine, and we have a whatsapp group which is sufficient...
7/20/22, 9:23 AM - +234 703 806 5681: You can. But people aren't as active on slack as they are on WhatsApp
7/20/22, 9:24 AM - +234 807 491 6916: Not prohibited per se.
They are not officially recognized by Udacity/ALX
You’re encouraged to communicate via Slack however other support communities will always exist
7/20/22, 9:24 AM - +234 803 928 8326: exactly
7/20/22, 9:24 AM - +234 706 632 1212: Oh alright.
7/20/22, 9:24 AM - +234 706 632 1212: Alright.
7/20/22, 9:26 AM - +234 803 928 8326: i think you guys have a zoom call today, you can just create a group and paste the link in the chat, trust folks would join
7/20/22, 9:57 AM - +234 810 002 0111: Hi, @2348061506913 I’ll suggest you go ahead and create the WhatsApp group. I think a number of us here are taking the DA nanogree and would benefit from being in the group.
7/20/22, 9:59 AM - +234 816 484 7452: ☺️
7/20/22, 10:12 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Av started sef...  Last night 😎
7/20/22, 10:27 AM - +234 703 436 6179: Nice suggestion 👏🏽
7/20/22, 12:11 PM - Dare: the essence of creating a simple community like whatsapp group to meet on assignments and projects outside the official slack cannot be over-emphasised. Just make sure you do not depend on the group alone for information, it's important you visit the official community (slack) daily for updates, instructions and to interact.
7/20/22, 12:44 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Increased interest rates means it becomes more expensive to borrow from banks.

It's a move to control inflation, but making it hard to get more money in circulation.

Another effect of this is that people will start moving money back to Government securities like T-bills and bonds. The government sold some and they had a lot of bids.
7/20/22, 12:53 PM - +234 812 216 8133: It simply means the buying power of Nigerians have dropped again.
7/20/22, 1:12 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Thank you for explaining 🙏🏾.

Can I refer him to you
7/20/22, 1:54 PM - +234 817 925 1327: But is this the real solution on the long run?

Because come to think of it how does this affect manufacturers that borrow and in turn, what's the impact on inflation  ?
This is what I don't understand. Ple
7/20/22, 1:55 PM - +234 817 925 1327: Please put more light on this scenario
7/20/22, 2:02 PM - Dare: From my own layman understanding, all I can see is that it will help govt to make more money and at the same time increase inflation.
7/20/22, 2:06 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 😂🥲
7/20/22, 2:06 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Bring back our Dollar Cards.
7/20/22, 2:13 PM - +234 817 925 1327: That's what I understand too bro..I don't understand how it'll reduce inflation on the *long run* practically speaking but let's hear from Mummy @2347038065681 .

7/20/22, 3:17 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Good afternoon everyone.

A friend wants to get started with Data Analyst track.

Please recommend platforms for him.

Preferably free platforms that also give certificates and have assignments and projects.

TIA.
7/20/22, 3:18 PM - +234 703 316 7142: This one deep o, and all for free?

What God cannot do does not exist🙏🏽
7/20/22, 3:18 PM - +234 814 192 1557: They are trying to reduce inflation by reducing the circulation of money by increasing interest rate, however, it will still affect the companies and citizens as it becomes more expensive to take loans. Same thing happening in the US
7/20/22, 3:19 PM - +234 708 145 1890: As far as the person is willing to write essays.

You will get free stuff.
7/20/22, 3:20 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmmnnn... Got it.

Don't take loans right now. Funny thing is there are other counter-intuitive things that Nigeria is doing.

7/20/22, 3:22 PM - +234 814 192 1557: It’s a risk move but let’s see how it ends
7/20/22, 3:23 PM - +234 703 806 5681: So, inflation is caused by too much money being in circulation.

To reduce the circulation of money, the CBN can increase interests rate:

1. To make it harder to borrow from banks (more borrowing leads to more spending). If you do borrow, you'll pay back more in interest. 

2. And also to make government securities more appealing to the investors. So investors give the govt their money for an extended period of time. Which reduces what is available for spending.
7/20/22, 3:23 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Please don't take loans for investments.
7/20/22, 3:23 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Smiles.

I know a data science platform that offers all these for free.

Indeed, what God cannot do does not exist 🤗

7/20/22, 3:25 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Does DataCamp teach excel, Tableau and Power BI?
7/20/22, 3:25 PM - +234 903 783 8682: They're currently giving out free courses through their collaboration with FB flames foundation.
7/20/22, 3:27 PM - +234 703 806 5681: There's Tableau and Power BI.

Don't know of excel.

Just take the PwC course for excel.

Or the person can go to Coursera, apply for financial aid and take whatever courses they want.
7/20/22, 3:27 PM - +234 903 783 8682: What's PwC?

Don't like the idea of coding in a controlled environment.

7/20/22, 3:39 PM - +234 703 806 5681: It's really cool. Very video based. Lots of explanations, questions in between, and assignments that require you to workout the code yourself on your computer and input the correct answer. With a few guides along the way.
7/20/22, 3:40 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I just noticed it too. So cool.

7/20/22, 6:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s the SQl/Python part not the personas segment feature aspect
7/20/22, 6:22 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Have you built any audience for users data that you send to SaaS tool?
7/20/22, 6:23 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Ok
7/20/22, 6:24 PM - +234 810 612 9023: Something like braze, yes?
7/20/22, 6:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The project is a funny one 

They have a reverse ETL tool (Census) but want to use Segment for the CDP to build like a recommendation system to move data from the DW to the SaaS tool
7/20/22, 6:24 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Yeah but Mixpanel, GAs and Twillo SMS
7/20/22, 6:25 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: @2348106129023 


In the past when you use personas and trait how did you use it?
7/20/22, 6:28 PM - +234 818 047 2075: In Segment or generally
7/20/22, 6:28 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: In Segment actually
7/20/22, 6:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: If there is a way to build that generally I should be able to leverage that idea
7/20/22, 6:30 PM - +234 810 612 9023: I built the data from RedShift, using the Python SDK, then in Segment we created a Braze destination and had it sent into Braze. We’ve done something similar for Facebook and Google too
7/20/22, 6:30 PM - +234 806 842 8052: I haven’t used it before. I was close to using it but the project didn’t start.
7/20/22, 6:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Hmmm

That mean you didn’t need the personals and trait feature in this instance.

7/20/22, 8:29 PM - +234 810 878 6913: How can I be a Machine Learning Engineer?
7/20/22, 8:29 PM - +234 903 783 8682: I couldn't agree more.

I got a World Bank project in 2020. It was my first big project.

I learnt so many lessons from that project.

First, I saw the power of a strong online presence. I didn't bid. They came to my DM. Their 'scout' saw my answer to a question on a Facebook group. 


2. This is the point I want to emphasize. They signed me as a junior consultant. Fortunately for me, the person signed as the senior consultant couldn't show up. So I had to handle the whole project and I did it fine and smooth.

Thirdly, I learnt the importance of good morals and manners. After signing the project, I learnt that one of the other candidates was disqualified because he showed up at the remote interview with a bare chest. But during my interview, I asked them to give me a moment to dress up properly before turning on my camera.

Have you tried placing a ggplot title into a box before? Been stuck on this for a while now
7/20/22, 10:12 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Into a box as how
7/20/22, 10:12 PM - +234 906 092 6282: What function did you use for the title layer?

7/20/22, 10:12 PM - +234 903 783 8682: Nice.
7/20/22, 10:13 PM - +234 809 183 1446: labs()
7/20/22, 10:13 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok you need the title to be inside a box. Like it is in Excel
7/20/22, 10:14 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Yes
7/20/22, 10:15 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok. Chart title in Excel is naturally (by default) in a box. But you can use ggplot to make behave same in R
7/20/22, 10:17 PM - +234 906 092 6282: The plot element functions are are for plot areas, legends and chart area but none for title. DrawRect won't work for it
7/20/22, 10:20 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Lemme see if plot.title argument in the theme layer has such customization
7/20/22, 10:21 PM - +234 809 183 1446: Yea, I tried working with most of the theme elements.
7/20/22, 10:21 PM - +234 809 183 1446: That only works with element_text()
7/20/22, 10:21 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Still no luck?
7/20/22, 10:21 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok yea

I have tried something similar, but we moved to use ClickUp instead of planner.

I saw a Power BI template that might make sense for this. We can talk more about the details, structure and data model.

7/22/22, 10:24 AM - +234 803 703 7908: *🛑HOW TO HIT HARD ON SCAMMERS*

Stop calling on Admins to remove scammers, It's a collective responsibility. The method am going to share does more damage to the scammer than ordinary removal.

They used link to join the platform, so it's practically impossible to block scammers from accessing the platform, But there is a way to get hackers account blocked and deactivate.

Now Listen...

1. Click on the offending scam post.

2. Amongst the options that come up click on More.

3. Amongst the next options click on Reply privately.

4. This opens the person’s WhatsApp page.  Click on the phone number at the top.

5 . This opens up his full accounts page, Scroll down to the bottom and click on Report and Block.

If 20 people do this we might be able to sanitise the platform faster. It does more damage to the scammer than ordinary removal.

@Police Cybercrime Alert.

I recently left Patricia to join Salad Africa- a fintech start up focused on improving employee financial wellness. We are about to launch our MVP publicly. The MVP is for Earned Wage Access. The E.W.A feature allows employees access to up to 50% of their accrued earned wage.

An example: Sola earns 500k Net monthly. After working for 2 weeks, he has earned 250k. We give him access to 50% of that amount at any time of the month. 

Zero interest. Only withdrawal charges (between 250 naira and 500) based on transaction. 

Employer does not pay to onboard us.

I would really love to see people using the product to gain further insights so please check us out and sign up

7/22/22, 12:28 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Y'all will be pumping more money than you can make
7/22/22, 12:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Not mine
7/22/22, 12:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: I'm having the same conversation with the person that shared.
7/22/22, 12:28 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Can't work out how they'll breakeven
7/22/22, 12:29 PM - +234 703 806 5681: But they won't incur liabilities. Their job is to ensure they have enough liquidity to meet the needs of the customers.
7/22/22, 12:29 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Honestly it sounds like they are unknownkingly running a ponzi
7/22/22, 12:30 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 😂😂

It's a B2B2C model
7/22/22, 12:30 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Employers are the customers technically.
7/22/22, 12:30 PM - +234 708 675 3621: It's not profitable in the long run
7/22/22, 12:30 PM - +234 703 806 5681: But the lack of fees makes it difficult to understand how they'll manage a default risk.
7/22/22, 12:30 PM - +234 812 216 8133: I'm interested in their revenue model because of the zero interest
7/22/22, 12:31 PM - +234 708 675 3621: What happens if your employer inflow plateau
7/22/22, 12:31 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Na wettin we dey discuss be this
7/22/22, 12:32 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Fee based. 250 - 500 naira on withdrawals
7/22/22, 12:32 PM - +234 708 675 3621: That would require people withdrawing almost every minute to break even sha
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Think they're banking on volume
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Might not be the best way to go for a startup
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Withdrawal charges won't generate enough to pay salaries talk more other costs. 

Except they are starting with the model to get users and then later they put charges. Because this model no be am!
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 706 439 6712: It's a strategy and a trap
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Fees on flutterwave and paystack transactions are low, but they have high volumes
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 708 675 3621: With that model yh I think so
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Exactly. Since they are new, withdrawal rate would be low
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Explain the strategy
7/22/22, 12:33 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Explain both
7/22/22, 12:34 PM - +234 812 216 8133: +1
7/22/22, 12:34 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Copy that.
7/22/22, 12:35 PM - +234 812 216 8133: This seems to be like a salary backed loan. What happens when an employee defaults?
7/22/22, 12:36 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Employer default.

The employer makes the payment, not the employee.
7/22/22, 12:37 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Now. I'm lost. Are they trying be like Bento? But with an access to 50% of the 50% of your salary?
7/22/22, 12:37 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Utiva is building something similar too.

Entrova
7/22/22, 12:38 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Maybe.

But Bento also does payroll management.

Like someone suggested on the other group, they need to find another service to render, otherwise they're giving a lot and getting almost nothing back.
7/22/22, 12:39 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Alright
7/22/22, 12:39 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Now think as an employer how would this be beneficial for you?
7/22/22, 12:40 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Beyond staff welfare support, there's the issue of liquidity management esp if you already make Advances and Loans available to your staff.

Now someone else takes that off your plate and leaves you with more cash in hand to manage other operational activities.
7/22/22, 12:40 PM - +234 708 675 3621: It's a necessity
7/22/22, 12:40 PM - +234 703 806 5681: From a finance, working capital point of view.
7/22/22, 12:40 PM - +234 812 216 8133: Good question
7/22/22, 12:42 PM - +234 708 675 3621: Wouldn't it make more sense to just leave that to stock brokers, that way things like these are off your plate and you're making a certain level of profit based on the investment portfolio the company has chosen for its employees
7/22/22, 12:42 PM - +234 803 810 5953: Check out this job at Seplat Energy Plc: https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3179870433
7/22/22, 12:43 PM - +234 817 511 5556: I'm not sure if I am looking at it from a different perspective but 
Isn't the concept mean to be like getting paid half your salary before you complete the month
7/22/22, 12:44 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Which means that whether you use the service or not you still get paid whatever is left of your salary at the end of the month
7/22/22, 12:46 PM - +234 817 511 5556: Technically implying that the money the employer is lending to the employee is what would have been at the end month
7/22/22, 12:47 PM - +234 909 880 8992: I think there would be a limit to what you can withdraw per month
7/22/22, 12:54 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Why would a stock broker manage liquidity for a private company?
7/22/22, 12:54 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 50% of your salary, max. And not more than 50k per time
7/22/22, 12:55 PM - +234 703 806 5681: No
7/22/22, 12:55 PM - +234 708 675 3621: <Media omitted>
7/22/22, 12:55 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Yes. You just get the value of the pay you've earned.
7/22/22, 1:02 PM - +234 909 880 8992: The BM is looking a bit risky

In a situation where the employer does not have enough to funds to loan and the employee needs money how will they manage that

They know folks love free and easy things. ( especially in Nigeria) 

Also, most salary earners usually  exhaust more than 50% of their salary, in the first 1- 2 weeks of salary payment. I love the business idea and the ease they trying to make for salary earners.

But this zero interest and access to 50% of your salary, from mid- month ,  It's a way to generate massive traffic.

But as time goes on, Interest would surely be added, at a very minimal rate, such that would won't see it as harmful. I doubt if in this our Nigeria of today, a business can be sustained, long-term on transactions fee or perhaps they have other revenue streams which compliments this business to make funds accessible and available for all requesting for up to 50% of their salaries before 30 days due date, at once...


The business idea is actually fantastic, but the model is not clear to me.. And as someone said, it's mostly not gonna be sustainable for long.


Unless there's something else they're not telling us.


Let's get some clarity on the business model, company, its investors, track record, credibility..e.t.c 


I am no financial expert though

7/22/22, 1:16 PM - +234 817 511 5556: If the company has a policy of budgeting salaries of the next month in the current month in its cash flow then they might be able to sustain it
7/22/22, 1:33 PM - +234 706 439 6712: My thoughts exactly.

7/22/22, 5:46 PM - +234 703 277 4936: Check DM
7/22/22, 6:00 PM - +234 703 160 7868: You've actually exhausted the thoughts of most people with this submission. You're already seeing the trojan horse they're trying to sell to create a market for their product idea. 

How will this pan out with the case of delayed salaries or even those employers that owe a backlog of salaries? There has to be some sort of guarantee from employers who may default in salary payments.
I want to believe they'll have other ideas to introduce other product offering to users once they take off successfully.

There is definitely something they're not telling us...
7/22/22, 6:03 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Point is, they don't need to tell us laslas. It's their business, it's their model, it's their trade secret.

But they appear to know what they're doing.
7/22/22, 6:10 PM - +234 703 160 7868: I agree.
7/22/22, 6:41 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Hello guys

7/22/22, 6:44 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Lol. I will do it if no one has done it before. I just don't want to work on something someone else has done before. What is the point? 😅

7/22/22, 6:47 PM - +234 708 531 6273: Besides any pointer on how to scrape drop-down datasets? 

Clicking multiple drop-downs generates the list I want.

How do I get python to select various combinations of options in different drop-downs and also scrape the ensuing results ?
7/22/22, 6:48 PM - +234 816 484 7452: RPA

Use the normal Python RPA Framework or tagui python

It will be easy
7/22/22, 6:51 PM - +234 816 484 7452: Or drop the site and do screen recording in my DM

@2347085316273 that is the full code containing table ingestion and merging of all tables csv into a single csv.
You only need to change or choose the state you want to ingest but you can also make that dynamic by looping through also.
And remember to remove the slicing part for LGAs as i added that just for testing.

Kudos to @2347040833826 , I worked with his initial template.👍

7/23/22, 12:29 PM - +234 818 047 2075: There is something I noticed. A good number of Nigerian companies are trying to reduce exposure to forex, due to the volatility. These companies are open to local alternatives when it comes to their major technology applications to reduce that exposure. Looks like there is an emerging market for Nigerian companies building tech products. 🤔 
For example, I know a Nigerian company which has made about 1 billion Naira from building an application which some Nigerian companies were paying over a million dollars for. 

Has anyone noticed this too?
7/23/22, 12:31 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Hmm hadn't noticed. But this is one great example of how emerging risk can be turned into opportunity for profit.
7/23/22, 12:33 PM - +234 708 145 1890: It makes a lot of sense. Funny thing is there are a number of products that would be quick wins if you check the market very well.

7/24/22, 2:27 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Good afternoon people. Please those who do private tutorial for people, how do you charge? Is it per hour or per month? How do you place your price?
7/24/22, 2:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Per hour is the best option. 

You charge based on your market value and rep 🥶
7/24/22, 2:30 PM - S+N Ayoade: Ope in all areas 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
7/24/22, 2:31 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can ask them what’s their charge rate for the training to determine if you can work with that or not.
7/24/22, 2:33 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Any amount they call for you convert it to hourly rate to see if it’s too small or manageable and most importantly you can also evaluate if it’s an opportunity to build your skills and brand in public through sharing knowledge. 

My first class was 2000/hr in 2018 as an upcoming, today I state my price 🥶. So there are many factor that will influence your rate
7/24/22, 2:35 PM - +234 806 347 2085: Alright. Thank you so much

7/24/22, 2:54 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: That’s like why 30$/hr. 

You rarely charge for the number of candidates though. Your rate is your rate irrespective of the number of participants
7/24/22, 2:55 PM - +234 806 347 2085: I for say oo
7/24/22, 2:56 PM - +234 806 347 2085: You did the math Wella 😁
7/24/22, 2:57 PM - +234 806 593 5396: My argument and conclusion with @2348162963527 is that no matter how much you charged, the candidate or institution can't pay for the value you will add or are adding to them or their candidates.
7/24/22, 2:57 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 😊👏🏽👏🏽
7/24/22, 2:59 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: You can only use that model if it’s for mentoring. That one you charge per candidate that need your service and you attend to them separately.

I personally don’t train again because the pay and the stress I go through the deliver the value don’t  match. So any masterclass or anything I decide to do is for giveaway. 

You people should release those training gigs to upcoming and let them enjoy it 😂😂
7/24/22, 3:02 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Any training gig that come to my table I pass it to someone else.

I understand not everyone here were able to attend the dbt meetup  where we add panelist attend to all questions from folks. So I’m blocked my calendar for next weekend for anyone to join to ask any question you have about data. 

What’s going to be flow of the session? It’s just going to be flex and cruise to ask me ANYTHING about data and hopefully I will be able to attend to all.

Don’t miss it. 

Feel free to share with other folks not a member of this community who would need it. It’s just strictly Q&A and nothing technical as it were only if needed

7/25/22, 12:44 PM - +234 817 511 5556: The Idea of wanting a mentor in some people comes from a place of pressure making them feel like they absolutely cannot succeed without a mentor and when they do not have access to people they know their only option is to turn to strangers

Semantic layers is a fraction of Metric layer. 

The basic idea of Metric is to solve one major challenge with most BI tool that tracks metrics. 

Let’s use Power BI where your semantic layer will be where your build your Data model , define all entities and relationships as well as the DAX measures that will be leveraged for reporting. 

The current approach create a bottleneck where any new metrics created with DAX is locked-in in Power BI and can’t be accessible outside Power BI. 
As an example, let’s say there is a measure that calculate customers with the highest purchase where there is a measure to do that. 

What if Product or Marketing folks need to setup a pipeline that reference that data for further downstream workflow like email marketing or any form of product analytics ? There is a bottleneck to access that at the moment because that metric is locked-in. A Data Scientist can’t access that metric for optimization, they will have to recreate the metric (this create what is called Siloed metrics across) 

So self service isn’t then self service as proposed which now lead to a new trend called *Headless BI* built on Metrics layer. 

What then is this new paradigm?

There is a single source of truth for all metrics that can be accessed across tools and not locked in by any tool. So see it as Decoupling Power BI where the Data modeling and DAX is separated. 

Data thought leaders believe this new paradigm will solve a lot of issues. 

I hope that help provide more context.
7/25/22, 3:35 PM - +234 810 831 6393: You can chose the *csv* format, copy the output link, then return to PBI, use the *import from web* option
7/25/22, 3:40 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The issue with the current infrastructure with most BI tool is what is called siloed metrics approach. 

Same way we had the issue of siloed data which was solved leveraging 1 single source of truth for Data. Metrics layer is also targeted to provide 1 single source of truth for metrics.
7/25/22, 3:41 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Makes sense to me now. Thanks for this. So where does metrics layer now sit if it isn't platform locked?

7/25/22, 3:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: The Idea is to have it sit as an abstraction between the Data warehouse and other tool that will leverage the metrics.
7/25/22, 3:44 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: RW>>DW>>Metrics Layer>> Data consumer (BI/DS/Stakeholders)
7/25/22, 3:55 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Update: 

We will be doing cleaning next weekend to allow new folks who need this access to this group. 

In other to create a fair system, I will share a post by sunday and ask everyone to drop a comment with a 1 week+ allowance. 

Anyone that doesn’t comment will be removed which shows inactivity. I will ask the folks to remove at random those that fall into that bucket will be categorized as inactive and churn


My WhatsApp data analyst and extraction team get ready.

7/25/22, 5:10 PM - +234 818 047 2075: So is the metrics built in SQL?
7/25/22, 5:14 PM - +234 806 593 5396: You might find this helpful

7/25/22, 5:15 PM - +234 816 631 6330: Thank bro😎
7/25/22, 5:19 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: There is currently lot of arguments on the best approach to the metrics layer. 

Most are tilting towards SQL since the layer will be consumed by Data Analyst as well as other less tech savvy folks. 

Another opinion is pushing for configuration templated YAML approach that will have an API extraction that can be exposed to any tool. 

So lot of conversations building up. There are tools already playing in that space though ; Transform, Trace, Gooddata etc. 

There is also any option of leverage dbt as the metrics layer. dbt has a feature in the beta stage called *metrics* (I haven’t used it but I’m read the issue in the codebase)

Interesting time in the space. 

So when folks are shouting semantics layer that’s basically what they are talking about. The rise of Headless BI
7/25/22, 5:21 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Ok thanks for this. Why is it called headless though. Just curious
7/25/22, 5:27 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I honestly don’t know 😂😂😂

BI that don’t have head 

Maybe because metrics consumption for business in the past is situated in the BI layer (the head 😂), now there is no head for metrics definition since the metrics can now be defined upstream in the infrastructure and shared across all tools downstream.

A good webinar on the Metric layer. 

Benn Stencil did some justice on the subject.
7/25/22, 5:29 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: I will check for other resources you can leverage.

7/25/22, 6:22 PM - +234 806 593 5396: In addition, 
1. After selecting share to Web, in the publish to the web dialogue, select the sheet of interest and change the file type to Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)

2. From Get data in power bi, select Web datasource and copy the link there.

You should be good to go
7/25/22, 6:24 PM - +234 810 831 6393: These tips aren't working for her. I guess it's a problem with the file size
7/25/22, 6:26 PM - +234 708 145 1890: But wait gan, a spreadsheet of 9gb?

Kilode. Please load into a DB.

🙏🏾
7/25/22, 6:28 PM - +234 803 159 7028: Only option?
7/25/22, 6:30 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Ahahahahahaha
7/25/22, 6:30 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Even I am confused, why 9gb for a spreadsheet file?
7/25/22, 6:31 PM - +234 806 593 5396: 💯
7/25/22, 6:35 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Maybe not, but for this file size, there will always be issues.

Infact loading to a db might be an issue.

Have you tried opening the file? it will eat all the RAM space one time 😂

But in a db, you will be fine. You can even optimse the data depending on how it is.
7/25/22, 6:39 PM - +234 803 159 7028: I can't open except I download it.

This is my second project 
The first one i did, I documented using Medium 

Now I want to do something I can put in my portfolio 

Is there a guide on how to do a portfolio worthy project ?

7/26/22, 7:22 AM - +234 905 555 4527: Hey, babe. 

The only guide I have is if he has done his research on the knowledge/ skills/ abilities he needs to get his dream job , he should work on projects that will showcase the specific skills. 

Especially if he wants to work in a specific industry/ data field. 

And, one way he can find out about the skills he needs to showcase is by reading through job descriptions and openings.
7/26/22, 7:50 AM - +234 813 312 7971: I think he meant how to document them….. instead of using medium to explain the project, what other means can he document or store the projects.
7/26/22, 7:52 AM - +234 905 555 4527: The concern is “is there a guide on how to do a portfolio worthy project”. 

I think the person wants to do a project to put in his portfolio.
7/26/22, 7:54 AM - +234 813 312 7971: Oh okay….
7/26/22, 8:38 AM - +234 816 484 7452: It was a capstone project for Accenture/Forage

And all I can say is *Omoooooooo*
7/26/22, 9:31 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Funny how the best Mentees are those you give just 15 mins of your time and the come back to you with *A whole world of Updates and Progress* 💯
7/26/22, 9:32 AM - +234 816 484 7452: *Mentors don't baby sit*.
Know that and know peace😅
7/26/22, 9:35 AM - +234 818 415 3106: low key its the mentees that are to be marking mentors like standing 4 now
7/26/22, 9:38 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂
7/26/22, 9:41 AM - +234 816 484 7452: You want to know a funny story about this Mentorship thing.
I created a group last year November for mentees interested in data and automation.
Out of 6, only one was really serious and putting in the work despite the schedule and distractions of life.

The one that survived the past 6 months is cashing out at least $1K every month now even as a 400 level Unilag Maths student
7/26/22, 9:47 AM - +234 818 415 3106: imagine opportunity which i wished i had or better put wished i knew better back then in school but Aluta yi sha ni

but then you still had 1 you can beat your chest that he is a product of your guidance imagine if none did
7/26/22, 9:48 AM - +234 817 511 5556: Likeeee
7/26/22, 9:50 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I think I would invite him here to tell his story... If only @2348108522573 and our elders will add him.

By the way his figures are now $2K monthly.
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Mine was book. I studied a lot. I could have channeled that energy to something better
7/26/22, 9:51 AM - +234 818 415 3106: God is the greatest
7/26/22, 9:52 AM - +234 814 669 0593: One reason the IT space will not get saturated anytime soon.  People quit!
7/26/22, 9:52 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly
7/26/22, 9:52 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Wait you all were serious with book in school ha
7/26/22, 9:53 AM - +234 817 511 5556: 🤣🤣 yes na as per good students
7/26/22, 9:54 AM - +234 816 484 7452: I introduced him to RPA 6 months ago and that is what he is cashing out with.

He was active on robocorp slack channel and monitoring the Job channel of slack shooting his shot

7/26/22, 10:07 AM - +234 706 439 6712: I have two of such folks.

One in uk, the other in U.S 

Made men.

A one-sentence mentorship was what I got .
7/26/22, 10:08 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Exactly

Same way *Elon Musk is a mentor to most of us* without him knowing 😂🤣
7/26/22, 10:08 AM - +234 816 484 7452: We would just be abiding by his tweet and lifestyle to pick one or two from him
7/26/22, 10:08 AM - +234 816 484 7452: We can even enter his DM 😂😂🤣
7/26/22, 10:10 AM - +234 814 669 0593: Omo
I didn't get direct mentorship.  
I consumed a lot of materials and hustled to this point. I watched people indirectly,  read up on memoirs about people's growth and most importantly, studied.
7/26/22, 10:15 AM - +234 706 439 6712: There was a great mathematician ( he solved one of the world's unsolved problems, and had field medals )   I admired and held in high esteem years back...  I finally got to speak with him online...I was kinda shaky..and couldn't believe I was talking with a world-renowned figure.

To my amazement, he's one of the simplest and sweet human beings, with a lot of good in his heart. He gave me some materials and a few words I don't play with, to date....

Those were enough push I needed  , to get me going and I don't take for granted one bit.
7/26/22, 10:16 AM - +234 812 216 8133: His name please

7/26/22, 10:26 AM - +234 706 439 6712: Am searching our conversation.
This was in 2017 

Can't seem to retrieve
7/26/22, 10:28 AM - +234 904 894 6475: For those who don't know: Perelman is the mathematician who solved 1 of the 7 Millennium Prize problems in math, posed in 2000. The problems represent the hardest (and most significant) unsolved math problems from the 20th century.

Each problem is worth $1 million for the first correct solution and till date only 1 of them has been solved... by Grigori Perelman. 

Perelman is not only famous for solving that problem (Poincare conjecture) but for *turning down the $1 million dollar prize*
7/26/22, 10:29 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Why did he turn down the money?
7/26/22, 10:29 AM - +234 904 894 6475: It's a bit of a long story o 😂
7/26/22, 10:29 AM - +234 903 839 1921: He turned down the money keh🤨🤨🤨
7/26/22, 10:30 AM - +234 816 484 7452: Our Data guys with all the maths they know should go and solve the questions now
7/26/22, 10:30 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Everything no be ML
7/26/22, 10:32 AM - +234 904 894 6475: But let's just say when you get to the very depths of math that only 0.01% of mathematicians can venture, it does something to your mind. You reason differently... Not mental problems per se, but the only fulfilment and gratification you tend to seek is on unraveling the *beauty of mathematics*. I'm a trained mathematician but I'll never know what it means to get to that point 😂🤣
7/26/22, 10:36 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Never say never

7/26/22, 10:47 AM - +234 904 894 6475: One of them is a problem in fluid mechanics. Anyone in engineering or physics should be familiar with Navier-Stokes equations.

With a fairly good knowledge of linear algebra and differential equations, anyone can derive this equation. But... It turns out that there's no mathematical proof of the *uniqueness* and *smoothness* of the solutions to Navier-Stokes, and these 2 properties are necessary for complete understand of fluid behaviour.

Engineers don't believe the proof is needed since the equations work well. Physicists and mathematicians believe the proof is required to understand whether there's a point of limitation of the equation, and if so where? 

Till date, some of the finest and greatest mathematicians  have pursued solution of this problem and have made significant progress, but there's still a long way to solving it.
7/26/22, 10:49 AM - +234 813 948 5182: <Media omitted>

7/26/22, 10:53 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Another problem is the *P versus NP* problem. The time complexity problem many of us are familiar with from computer science.

It's just a problem of whether an algorithm that is solvable in non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) implies that it is also solvable in polynomial time (P).

Mathematicians and computer scientists have a strong urge that P cannot be equivalent to NP, but we are not satisfied by someone's urge. We need proof 😂
7/26/22, 10:53 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Honestly
7/26/22, 10:57 AM - +234 703 316 7142: This problem ehn😂😂
7/26/22, 10:59 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Sometimes your gut is enough to prove a proof😂😂. Make the proof no you go where you no know. You say it's just common sense.
7/26/22, 11:01 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Anyone that knows Ability will know He's not soo normal 😂

7/26/22, 11:06 AM - +234 904 894 6475: And beyond what I mentioned earlier about mathematicians way of thinking, there were also some issues with the global math community that Perelman was dissatisfied with.

He published about 3 major papers that led up to the solution of the Poincare conjecture. It took around 3 or 4 years of expert review for his solution to be certified as correct and complete.

But in that period of time, there were other prominent mathematicians (especially from US), who had been racing towards the solution, who tried to discredit him and rubbish his work. Perelman was not a very social mathematician in terms of relating well with other mathematicians, and so most of them treated him like he didn't belong. You know that kind of cult behaviour where people feel someone who isn't in their clique cannot and should not have a seat on the table. It was this kind of behaviour that was the last straw for Perelman.

Imagine trying to run away from so many issues of society and finally you think mathematics is the place where you can hide from all those problems, only to be eventually treated the same way by mathematicians you consider family 🥲

So after solving the Poincare conjecture, Professor Perelman resigned from mathematics work and went back to his village 💀
7/26/22, 11:06 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Maths don't send your guts, we need proof. That's why Prof Andrews Wiles spent 8 years + 1 extra year to prove the fermat last theorem, a generalization of the pythagoras theorem.
7/26/22, 11:07 AM - +234 708 145 1890: 😬

Nawa oo... Resigned to his village.
7/26/22, 11:08 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Yes, man wanted to be away from the public eye.
7/26/22, 11:08 AM - +234 703 316 7142: I know right😂😂
7/26/22, 11:08 AM - +234 904 894 6475: That Fermat last theorem proof stamped Andrew Wiles as one of the greatest living geniuses. It would have earned him the Field's medal, but you don't get a Field's medal after 40 .

I think Andrew Wiles was 41 or 42 when he finished solving the problem.
7/26/22, 11:09 AM - +234 812 216 8133: <Media omitted>
7/26/22, 11:10 AM - +234 812 216 8133: That age cap makes no sense to me. Nobel doesn't have a cap, why should the field medal have one?
7/26/22, 11:10 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Yes, that's him. Russia produced some of the best mathematicians
7/26/22, 11:12 AM - +234 904 894 6475: It's just a way to encourage exceptionality from a young age. Also, in math, it becomes increasingly difficult to produce original, groundbreaking work when you start getting to 50 or 60. 

That's what the statistics shows.
7/26/22, 11:14 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Whilst I agree, they would be exceptions like Arthur Ashkin who won the Nobel prize in Physics at 96 years
7/26/22, 11:14 AM - +234 812 216 8133: John Goodenough won his at 97 too
7/26/22, 11:14 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Yeah, that's why there's no Nobel prize in mathematics. Mathematics is just one hell of a different field
7/26/22, 11:15 AM - +234 812 216 8133: So age shouldn't be a barier, some are late bloomers
7/26/22, 11:15 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Also, I hope you are aware that most of the Nobel prizes are awarded for work that the recipient did many years before?
7/26/22, 11:16 AM - +234 812 216 8133: Sure. Once your work has passed the review stage which can take years
7/26/22, 11:19 AM - +234 904 894 6475: For example, Roger Penrose (my favourite cosmologist) got the Nobel prize for discovering that black holes were proof of Einstein's general relativity theory.

Penrose's work was from the 70s or so.
7/26/22, 11:20 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Stephen Hawking didn't get a Nobel prize before he died in 2018, because his own aspect of black hole research had not been experimentally verified.
7/26/22, 11:21 AM - +234 817 511 5556: The way Hallowed nearly drove us mad abi!!!
7/26/22, 11:22 AM - +234 812 216 8133: 😂😂
7/26/22, 11:22 AM - +234 904 894 6475: So I agree, age should not be a barrier. But I think the Field's medal committee just restricted it that way so that there's no confusion as to who to award if the number of deserving mathematicians becomes too high.

Also, they award it every 4 years, making it the world's most prestigious academic achievement.
7/26/22, 11:23 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Don't mention😂😂
7/26/22, 11:23 AM - +234 812 216 8133: True. Sometimes, a research could be well ahead of its time.
7/26/22, 11:24 AM - +234 816 484 7452: 🤣😂

You allow one small boy to trouble you.. Thank God MFM is close to UNILAG
E get why
7/26/22, 11:24 AM - +234 904 894 6475: It's not just review. In fact, most times we know that the theories are correct. But in physics, chemistry or medicine, a Nobel prize can only be awarded if there's experimental verification that something works.

So it's easier or faster to get a Nobel prize in experimental physics than in theoretical physics.
7/26/22, 11:24 AM - +234 817 511 5556: Somebody tortured me for three straight years 😩
7/26/22, 11:27 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Nigerian mathematicians that are still solving trivial math research problems 🤦🏽‍♂️

I have not heard of a single Nigerian mathematician that has been considered world class in terms of groundbreaking work to earn the respect of the global community.

Worse, our media has a way of overestimating trivial research successes.
7/26/22, 11:27 AM - +234 818 721 1515: 😂😂😂
7/26/22, 11:28 AM - +234 817 511 5556: Ehm because them no dey give book value for this side
7/26/22, 11:28 AM - +234 812 216 8133: We have some that're doing great int'l though
7/26/22, 11:28 AM - +234 818 721 1515: Leemao...


Crazy old days...
7/26/22, 11:32 AM - +234 818 213 4637: Mama and Son 😂🤩
7/26/22, 11:39 AM - +234 904 894 6475: Part of the reason for this problem is that the world's great mathematicians were those that were trained from great mathematicians too. We have that disconnect over here. 

Our mathematicians don't tend to have world class mentors. Maybe just very few exceptions, but these ones don't go ahead to further push the boundaries.

Our mathematicians don't get to study in some of the greatest places to get nurtured in rigorous mathematics and meet really great mathematicians, e.g, Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Stanford, etc. If you check most of the Nigerians that make it into prestigious universities, you will find that it's literally all other areas except mathematics. So our mathematicians hardly make it into places where the greatness gets handed down. Kings are raised through kings. The closer you are to one, the better.
7/26/22, 11:41 AM - +234 809 945 1658: adebanjotiti1@gmail.com
7/26/22, 11:41 AM - +234 904 894 6475: No doubt. But not at a really world-class level.

Although I must say, it has become much harder now. The problems that will get you global recognition for groundbreaking work are the extremely hard ones. And it is the grandmasters in the field that pursue those kinds of problems.

One about cleaning up your portfolio.

The second was done around February about how I'll be rebalancing and investing in a declining market.
Think it's titled, "income split tutorial"
7/28/22, 6:39 AM - +234 703 350 4764: Best in what? 
They don't teach anything.
You will end up teaching yourself 🥲

KNIME is interesting. I haven't found a use case for it recently tho.
7/28/22, 9:10 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Tosin on LinkedIn seems to use it at work
7/28/22, 9:10 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Is it open source abi companies have to pay for a license too?
7/28/22, 9:11 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea... I noticed he took the L2 certification recently.
7/28/22, 9:12 AM - +234 703 806 5681: She

7/28/22, 9:16 AM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohh... Yeaaaa. I saw Tosin's post about the KNIME certification.

There's another guy Emmanuel Eze that took it recently. I think I confused Tosin for him for a moment there.

Thank you for correcting me.

Anyone interested in knowledge sharing can give it a shot.

7/28/22, 11:40 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: One easiest way to strengthen your knowledge is to create an environment to teach it. It will force you to learn the stuff well because you don’t want to mess up

7/28/22, 11:46 AM - +234 703 845 5619: one hour every week... for close marking
7/28/22, 12:03 PM - +234 703 845 5619: Role filled. Thank you 🙏🏼
7/28/22, 12:13 PM - +234 703 806 5681: But the IDE will remain RStudio.

They want to start creating software for other languages
7/28/22, 12:20 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea
7/28/22, 12:20 PM - +234 906 092 6282: I gwt
7/28/22, 12:20 PM - +234 906 092 6282: *get
7/28/22, 12:21 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Ohh.. Nice!

Possibly extend their IDE?
7/28/22, 12:21 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Or make new ones.

RStudio can already be used to write Python too.
7/28/22, 12:24 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yes... You can write Python, SQLite in RStudio.

Fair enough. I am just thinking why not rival VScode 🤔

Or a multi-purpose editor for anything Data-related and allow people add extensions.
7/28/22, 12:25 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Maybe they'll consider this too.
7/28/22, 1:15 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Please bosses
How can one convert a number 1571023294 to date?
The type type is currently in Whole Number
7/28/22, 1:16 PM - +234 906 092 6282: This number: 1571023294. Other values are within this range too.

It's in Power BI
7/28/22, 1:19 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Not seeing a date in this.

And it's not looking like the regular 44,3982 or something.

Can you clarify how the value was derived?
7/28/22, 1:21 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Starting and ending times. Those are the name of the columns
7/28/22, 1:22 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Like 15/07/2002 to 23/02/1994 yea?
7/28/22, 1:23 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yes. 
But it's in integer yet
7/28/22, 1:24 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I get you boss.

dmyydmyy

This seems to be the format.
7/28/22, 1:29 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea. How can one convert it now?
7/28/22, 1:47 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I think if it's possible to split into two first then format.
7/28/22, 1:48 PM - Oluwadara Adepoju: Hello everyone, please what is a basic salary for a mid level data Analyst role in a small UK startup?
7/28/22, 1:48 PM - Oluwadara Adepoju: *Monthly salary
7/28/22, 1:50 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok
7/28/22, 1:51 PM - +234 909 431 5803: With DMYY as the date format. Splitting it won't be easy...
7/28/22, 1:52 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Exactly...
7/28/22, 1:52 PM - +234 803 353 6901: Check Glassdor
7/28/22, 1:52 PM - +234 906 092 6282: How about converting to text first
7/28/22, 1:53 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Note the columns are not in date time format yet
7/28/22, 1:55 PM - +234 909 431 5803: Yeah. Converting to text is the only way to split it but the issue I was pointing out is this.

Take this example, 11222
Is this 1-Dec-2022 or 11-Feb-2022?
7/28/22, 1:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: The length is varying.

do you want to try python or R in Power BI, that should work fine.

lubridate will do it neat.
7/28/22, 1:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Another angu
7/28/22, 1:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: It could actually be 

ddmyy
7/28/22, 1:56 PM - +234 708 145 1890: not dmyy
7/28/22, 1:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Can't be soo sure...
7/28/22, 1:58 PM - +234 909 431 5803: Yeah.
Maybe more samples of the data could help clarify
7/28/22, 1:58 PM - +234 906 092 6282: 🤔. True o
7/28/22, 1:59 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Power BI
But Lubridate is R
7/28/22, 1:59 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok
7/28/22, 1:59 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, you can write R or Python script in Power BI.
7/28/22, 1:59 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I have never had a need to before.
7/28/22, 2:00 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yea
Ok. My fear is Power BI is choosy about R or Python libraries that work

7/28/22, 2:02 PM - +234 909 431 5803: Made a quick Google search.

7/28/22, 2:10 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Hi if the values were derived from Excel then it is the number of days or seconds since 1900. Sometimes Excel saves the date in this integer format.
7/28/22, 2:14 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Are you saying this M code can help out in our case too?
7/28/22, 2:14 PM - +234 906 092 6282: The number of days from Jan 1 1900 is not up to this value
7/28/22, 2:14 PM - +234 909 431 5803: Probably
7/28/22, 2:15 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Excel could have converted it when we tried it
7/28/22, 2:16 PM - +234 818 047 2075: Oh ok. Could it be seconds?
7/28/22, 2:18 PM - +234 909 431 5803: From what I'm seeing online, I think it's a Unix based time which is the number of seconds that has elapsed since 1-Jan-1970.

So the Power Query image should work.
7/28/22, 2:18 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Wr don't even know
7/28/22, 2:19 PM - +234 906 092 6282: We will try try this
7/28/22, 2:24 PM - +234 818 047 2075: This is probably the answer. Just found out about the unix epoch which starts at 1970 and not 1900. 1900 is for Excel
7/28/22, 2:28 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok boss

7/28/22, 5:40 PM - +234 817 965 1769: it is a strucutured data
7/28/22, 5:41 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I don't think a need for loop.

Major issue here is the data entry.
7/28/22, 5:42 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I would say, create and index,
Print the index once the app opens,
Let users enter the index and not the company.

Free text is aleays an issue with data entry.
7/28/22, 5:42 PM - +234 817 965 1769: if the customer picked YDF,
how do you check your df to know the equivalent discount and do something like df[''discount''] * 4
7/28/22, 5:43 PM - +234 810 831 6393: Can you disable any anti-virus temporarily?
7/28/22, 5:43 PM - Richie: Gmat will sha be included
7/28/22, 5:44 PM - +234 817 965 1769: so if infront of YDF we have 0.20, it will be 0.20 * 4

if its AXA, the calculation can be 0.35 * 4

etc
7/28/22, 5:46 PM - +234 708 145 1890: There are several ways to get this.
7/28/22, 5:46 PM - +234 817 965 1769: yes I understand. People that needs the app understand how to correctly type the name. Not really an issue

I can use .lower() also
7/28/22, 5:47 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You can do something like this:

df['discount'][df['company']=='YDF']
7/28/22, 5:47 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Alright then.
7/28/22, 5:47 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Beat me to it.
7/28/22, 5:50 PM - +234 817 965 1769: the YDF will be variable typed by the user
7/28/22, 5:50 PM - +234 817 965 1769: so it can be anything
7/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yup Yup
7/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 708 145 1890: So, you will just define a function that will run this.
7/28/22, 5:51 PM - +234 708 145 1890: 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾
7/28/22, 5:53 PM - Joe: key_value = dict(zip(df.company_name,df.discount))


key_value[company_name]

Will give you exactly what you want (only the value)

If you want to use pandas, there's a to_dict method
7/28/22, 5:54 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Yeah, so you replace YDF there with the variable name
7/28/22, 5:55 PM - +234 708 145 1890: So, a dictionary is better than a dataframe yea?
7/28/22, 5:55 PM - Joe: I like this
7/28/22, 5:56 PM - +234 703 316 7142: This will create another leg of data redundancy though
7/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Since he can just work directly on the data. You can also just use map function and use lamba to create an anonymous function within it that solves the problem
7/28/22, 5:57 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Hmmnnn...
7/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: def calc_discount(df, company):
    result = list(map(lambda x: x*4, df.Discount[df['Company']==company]))
    return result
7/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: This will solve it
7/28/22, 6:13 PM - +234 703 316 7142: Note, the company parameter should be a string
7/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, put a try and except somewhere.

Then to.lower on the company string.

I would add strip() too.
7/28/22, 6:15 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Build to be error proof.
7/28/22, 6:30 PM - +234 817 965 1769: @2347033167142 and others thanks. Solved
7/28/22, 6:30 PM - +234 817 965 1769: I can go home in peace and not pieces now

7/28/22, 8:45 PM - +234 706 942 4890: This people suppose no dey run Olympic again... they are not human😩
7/28/22, 9:16 PM - +234 703 678 8365: I've been here before. 

Reach out by calling the HR that sent in the initial offer you rejected asking if the offer is still available. 

HR people don't like to feel defeated. Also, it's stressful and a waste of resources to start looking for another best fit so your offer is usually available for some days after you reject it. 

The worst you can get is a no. But don't ever not reach out. Swallow your pride and reach out ASAP.
7/28/22, 9:19 PM - +234 703 678 8365: An extra tip I used was that I said  the pay didn't match what I desired as the next step in my career path but I reconsidered and would like to be a part of the team. 

I eventually got a higher offer when they reached out to accept me.
7/28/22, 9:20 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Sweet!
7/28/22, 9:21 PM - +234 814 669 0593: Mail the HR if the offer is still on the table. Tell them you have reconsider and you will like to join them.
7/28/22, 9:22 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Not impossible. Cheetahs are fast but can only run for a short burst of time to avoid overheating.

And if they were stalking the animal as it was trying to evade them, then... it's even more possible.
7/28/22, 9:36 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Not yet. The M code is not yielding
7/28/22, 10:38 PM - +234 909 757 7916: Hello everyone I have a couple product questions I need help clarifying the answers
7/28/22, 10:38 PM - +234 909 757 7916: If you can help please do😩🙏🏾
7/28/22, 10:38 PM - +234 909 757 7916: <Media omitted>
7/28/22, 10:39 PM - +234 909 757 7916: What could the answer to this be?
7/28/22, 10:39 PM - +234 909 757 7916: I picked A, I want to see if I am right
7/28/22, 10:57 PM - +234 703 678 8365: I'm not a product manager but based on my experience carrying out A/B testing, I'd choose A.
7/28/22, 11:06 PM - +234 904 894 6475: The link between the control (group A) and the treatment (group B) is the homepage. So Option 4 is ruled out.

Option 1 would have been correct based on above context, but the hypothesis is testing specifically for relationship between commercial content volume and clicks, rather than just homepage views. So option 1 is ruled out. 

For this to work, both treatment and control groups must specifically view the commercial content, then the proportion of clicks is analysed from those views. This makes Option 5 the correct answer.
7/28/22, 11:15 PM - +234 904 894 6475: I just did a rethink on my last paragraph. 

Option 3 should be the correct answer because the hypothesis is checking for proportion of clicks with respect to quantity of commercial content. Not with respect to views on commercial content.

Would like to read others' thoughts as well.
7/28/22, 11:19 PM - +234 703 678 8365: This is convincing as the CTR is a metric that will be used in this experiment.
7/29/22, 6:48 AM - +234 703 160 7868: I'll pick Option 2. 

None of the answers are correct.
7/29/22, 6:52 AM - +234 703 160 7868: This is an ad (commercial content) effectiveness experiment. 

To likely determine the factor(s) that will lead to fewer clicks through to sponsored pages, you've to establish a baseline in one of the two user groups. If Group A still sees the homepage feed as it is, it means they are the baseline (control group) and won't be exposed to the experiment. Then this leaves you with the users in Group B. It is within this group, you're now able to determine whether there will be a lift or dip in revenue from sponsored content because they're the ones who'll see lesser commercial content (ad). So my answer will be the users in Group B are the ones exposed to the experiment.

7/29/22, 10:00 AM - +234 703 316 7142: I don't think there is a limit to number of email campaigns you can send. You can Google it sha.
7/29/22, 10:00 AM - +234 703 316 7142: It's just some extra features you won't be able to use
7/29/22, 10:00 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Like email scheduling and the likes
7/29/22, 10:09 AM - +234 803 420 2314: Why as in? 🤔
7/29/22, 10:09 AM - +234 703 806 5681: I think there is.

Site says 2000 per day and 10000 per month.

But I'm talking about whether or not there's a limit to the number of emails you can collect on a free plan.

Before Intuit took over, there used to be.
7/29/22, 10:14 AM - +234 803 420 2314: @2347064396712 please help me understand so as ti respond properly...
7/29/22, 10:14 AM - +234 703 316 7142: I can't remember again, their is a limit to the number of saved contacts
7/29/22, 10:16 AM - +234 802 415 0592: You cannot have more than 2000 subscribers on the free plan
7/29/22, 10:16 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Lol 😂 

The moment you reject an offer either explicitly by saying No or indirectly via a counter offer in this instance the offer is off the table. 

Going back again definitely is a 50/50 but it put you off as a desperate person when you go back begging for the offer you rejected. It’s the psychology around counter offers
7/29/22, 10:18 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Most won’t even answer you which is why when countering an offer just know it’s a 50/50 they may rescind the offer or accept it. 

It’s a game of gambling
7/29/22, 10:20 AM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Option 3 kinda look like it
7/29/22, 10:22 AM - +234 807 491 6916: Thank you Chief!

7/30/22, 2:08 PM - +234 703 316 7142: You can just union the 1st column with the 2nd column 🤷🏽‍♂️
7/30/22, 2:14 PM - +234 806 593 5396: 😄
7/30/22, 2:15 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Thought UNION is for tables
7/30/22, 2:15 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, 

You can do 
Select col1 from table
Union
Select col2 from table
7/30/22, 2:16 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Abii
7/30/22, 2:16 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Gives you the result you want.
7/30/22, 2:16 PM - +234 906 092 6282: That one is the same table
7/30/22, 2:16 PM - +234 906 092 6282: He can just concatenate them in Power Query
7/30/22, 2:16 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Yea, it will work fine 😊
7/30/22, 2:17 PM - +234 706 439 6712: Very insightful and informative. AMA session.


MORE Energy ,boss👍🏻
7/30/22, 2:17 PM - +234 708 145 1890: I don't think he wants to concat, he wants a table with one column.
7/30/22, 2:17 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Ok
7/30/22, 2:17 PM - +234 806 593 5396: I'm not sure I understand his requirement too 🤦🏿‍♂️
7/30/22, 2:19 PM - +234 708 145 1890: He wants to put the column away_team under the home_team.

So, it's one long column instead

I will send it.
7/30/22, 2:22 PM - +234 810 002 0111: How can I carry out a union in PowerBI please?
7/30/22, 2:22 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Oh.... I see 👀
7/30/22, 2:22 PM - +234 906 092 6282: I have a suggestion
7/30/22, 2:23 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Take the data to Excel, put each column in separate table...
Then load the two tables to Power BI
7/30/22, 2:23 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Then you can use UNION function in Power BI
7/30/22, 2:24 PM - +234 806 593 5396: He can duplicate the table.... remove column b in the first table, remove column a in the second and append the two tables to achieve the final result
7/30/22, 2:24 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Yes. No need going to Excel👍
7/30/22, 2:25 PM - +234 906 092 6282: Append in Power Query, UNION in DAX
7/30/22, 2:25 PM - +234 906 092 6282: They work the same way
7/30/22, 2:26 PM - +234 703 954 3297: Do I need to sign in to PowerBI service to publish there?
7/30/22, 2:27 PM - +234 806 593 5396: Yes please...
7/30/22, 2:27 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Sweet...
7/30/22, 2:27 PM - +234 708 145 1890: This was what I was thinking.
7/30/22, 2:28 PM - +234 708 145 1890: Delivered to your DM boss
7/30/22, 2:28 PM - +234 806 593 5396: No time to think of something else 😂

7/30/22, 2:40 PM - +234 806 593 5396: The column name must be the same.... 


*rename the column to have the same name
7/30/22, 2:41 PM - +234 806 593 5396: *rename the column before you append
7/30/22, 3:04 PM - +234 810 002 0111: This worked! Thank you @2348065935396 and everyone else for your contribution.

7/30/22, 9:11 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Come to think of it @2348106129023  was talking about acquisition which is very true. 


I won’t be surprised if one of the cloud provider just buy the major MDS player 😂😂
7/30/22, 9:13 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: Airbyte acquired Grouparoo to give the Reverse ETL folks a chase 😃😃


Google acquired Looker and Datafold (dbt competitor) but developed by Google.  It’s funny Google devs use dbt and not Datafold

I saw on dbt channel one Google guy introduced himself and was like “though we built Datafold but most of my team use dbt😀”


What if Microsoft wake up one day and buy all of them over 😃😃?


Will the accept?
7/30/22, 9:14 PM - Opeyemi Fabiyi: It’s really an interesting time actually 😀
7/30/22, 9:17 PM - +234 818 047 2075: 😂😂

7/31/22, 7:01 PM - +234 708 674 2097: My laptop is low, but will check it out immediately its restored. And secondly, this video is not really subtracting the first row from the second one. It's only working on the index column..
7/31/22, 7:03 PM - +234 708 674 2097: I was thinking if I can use the index column to get another column of the data then create another custom column where the initial column will subtract the new index column.. I don't know how achievable it is , but will try it when my laptop is on
7/31/22, 7:05 PM - +234 909 431 5803: The video shows how to get the previous row and then you can do the substraction.
7/31/22, 7:13 PM - +234 810 878 6913: Okay

7/31/22, 7:43 PM - S+N Ayoade: You have only year out of the 3 args needed to make a date
7/31/22, 7:44 PM - +234 810 337 1133: So how can it be made complete?
7/31/22, 7:47 PM - +234 703 350 4764: So how can I make it a complete date ?
7/31/22, 7:47 PM - +234 909 431 5803: What's the date you want to see?
First of the month?
7/31/22, 7:48 PM - +234 703 350 4764: I just want the column to be converted to date.
It reading as a text on power bi
7/31/22, 7:49 PM - +234 703 350 4764: I have change it to date too on power bi still same result 
1905
7/31/22, 7:50 PM - +234 909 431 5803: I get.

If I give you a year, 2022, for example and I say you should convert to a date. What would you give back as the answer?
7/31/22, 7:52 PM - +234 909 431 5803: What you want to to do can be achieved with the YEAR function.

But best to know why the "convert to date" didn't work as you expected.
7/31/22, 7:54 PM - +234 703 350 4764: I think the data source 
The year column is not well documented as a date format
7/31/22, 7:56 PM - +234 909 431 5803: This message was deleted
7/31/22, 7:57 PM - +234 909 431 5803: Add a new column in D2

 ```=YEAR(B2, 1, 1)``` 
That would give you a date.
7/31/22, 8:15 PM - +234 703 350 4764: Thanks bro

8/1/22, 7:35 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Guysssss, I have an offer for you this August.

Before I carry it to LinkedIn and my other media channels.

And it's because I like you people too much 😉.

It's dividend season in the stock market this month. 
AND the US stock market had it's best month in July, since November 2020.

This means, people who have been invested so far have enjoyed some big benefits by way of dividends and Naira hedge against inflation. 

Yet, so many of you didn't get in on the action. 

So... I want to teach 10 people how to start investing in stocks this month 

The  *first 5 people* to subscribe will get in at N25,000 only ($35).

This will be a *beginners class*. 

Whether you've bought your first stock (because you guessed at it) or you want to start buying now. 

*It's just N25,000* and it will NEVER be this price again. The going rate in the market for a live class cost at least N150,000 ($200). 


What you'll learn:

✅ Understanding the stock market and how it works
✅ What to look out for while choosing a stock
✅ When to buy and sell
✅ Where to buy/apps
✅ Diversifying your portfolio
✅ Managing your portfolio or outsourcing? 
✅ Understanding index funds and ETFs and how to use them
✅ Buy your first share.
✅ 1 month support group to answer any questions you have and get my opinion on anything. 

This will be a hands-on session for both the Nigerian stock market and the US stock market. 


If you're interested, just respond with "YES" or send me a DM. 


Again, I have just *5 slots at N25,000 only*

The next 5 people will pay N35,000. 

And then I'm closing for this round of lectures because I want everyone to feel involved and ask questions. 

Any subsequent person will jump in at N50,000 and it will keep going up until we hit the standard market rate. 

💃🏽💃🏽

Can't wait to teach you everything I know. 

See you in class. 


P.S. You're the first people I'm sharing with. 

In the next 12 hours it's going to other communities. *So if you miss the 5-10 slots you'll learn at N50,000*

✌🏽

8/1/22, 10:56 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Why you dey disguise
8/1/22, 10:57 AM - +234 703 316 7142: Should I start casting people I know they can help you?
8/1/22, 11:12 AM - +234 703 806 5681: You have less than 1 hour to go before this offer at this price becomes open to other people.

It's still N35,000 for you until 12pm today.

After this you'll buy at N50,000.

Ask yourself if you'd rather not pay less to make more from this stock market that's raising millionaires in this decade? 🤷🏽‍♀️

It's a bear market, this means so much is selling at a discount.

If you learn this now and get in now, you'll basically be giving yourself a Black Friday sale 😂 and making more than those who bought during the boom. 

Interested?

Send "Yes" to my DM.
8/1/22, 11:13 AM - +234 703 806 5681: 3 slots to go. It will NEVER be N35,000 again.

100 money savvy people will be learning about saving for the Rainy days this Friday.

8/1/22, 12:09 PM - +234 703 397 0467: Please, I am trying to do this excel task by following this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jEGuoXz02c&list=PL_WHfGYyPRuOWqablvZAw3iJHUoIGk7F3&index=3). The guy is cleaning up the data by making sure the date column is formatted as date (timestamp: 23:30 in the video) by using ALT A E F. I tried the same on my sheet, but it isn't working. 

Please can someone guide me on how this can be done or why it's not working for me?
8/1/22, 12:09 PM - +234 703 397 0467: <Media omitted>
8/1/22, 12:20 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Time up.

Thank you everyone for doing business with me.

I'll be sharing this offer with other communities now.

If you're lucky enough to say "Yes" before the last 2 slots of N35,000 is taken, then lucky you!

Otherwise I'll be sending you an invoice of N50,000 😘
8/1/22, 12:24 PM - +234 706 439 6712: whats the error messaging ur  getting ?
8/1/22, 12:26 PM - +234 703 397 0467: no error message. just that the date column isn't transforming as expected

8/1/22, 12:58 PM - +234 703 397 0467: It should make the date column an actual date.
Its just there as a text.
Their is a way the guy automated it in the video
8/1/22, 1:08 PM - +234 703 806 5681: 2 slots of 50,000 sold.

'.describe()' is an inbuilt method for the pandas library I.e it's part of the package.

As a programmer, you can contribute to the pandas library by creating an inbuilt function too. If accepted, it will be added to the new release.

8/3/22, 9:44 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Can someone send dollar to you on Chipper too?
8/3/22, 9:55 AM - +234 809 836 4427: No, you receive in naira or the currency of the Country you register with
8/3/22, 9:59 AM - +234 703 806 5681: But someone in the US can send me money, right?
8/3/22, 10:33 AM - +234 809 836 4427: Yes but the person has to be using chipper cash 

Why not create PayPal if the main goal is to be receiving money from the US this is a better option
8/3/22, 10:43 AM - +234 703 806 5681: How will I withdraw the PayPal?
8/3/22, 10:48 AM - +234 809 836 4427: Setup a PayPal business account 

To withdraw set up a Payoneer account 
This gives you a US bank account to link to your PayPal 

PayPal > US Bank account > Payoneer > your Nigerian bank 

That’s the withdrawal process
8/3/22, 10:50 AM - +234 817 840 3767: Payoneer does this too and it's easier to setup t
8/3/22, 10:55 AM - +234 809 836 4427: Oh really
8/3/22, 10:58 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Nigerian dom account, right?

8/3/22, 11:17 AM - +234 708 145 1890: FPL... Fantasy Premier League,

You build your team, play against other teams, win points and top the table.
8/3/22, 11:17 AM - +234 703 956 6136: How
8/3/22, 11:17 AM - S+N Ayoade: Oh…

So can we watch while they’re playing?
8/3/22, 11:19 AM - +234 909 778 5164: Remain whose team I go mirror
8/3/22, 11:24 AM - +234 708 145 1890: You still have to monitor weekly,

I think it's linked to how the players are in real life. So if they are injured and all, you need to watch and monitor your team closely.
8/3/22, 11:26 AM - +234 818 415 3106: Na to dey Mirror dey go
8/3/22, 11:26 AM - +234 909 778 5164: U get

I use the PayPal route
8/3/22, 11:40 AM - +234 809 836 4427: Normal bank account 
But the rate will be at the official bank rate 

Current rate is 416/420
8/3/22, 11:46 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Ugh. That's wasting money na ☹️
8/3/22, 11:49 AM - +234 817 840 3767: You can make use of your Nigerian Dom account and withdraw cash in hard currency
8/3/22, 11:50 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Alright
8/3/22, 11:50 AM - +234 703 806 5681: Thank you guys
8/3/22, 11:50 AM - +234 817 840 3767: Especially if your account is an inflow account that accepts transfer

8/3/22, 12:36 PM - +234 703 160 7868: You're practically the  manager (Guardiola/Mourinho/Klopp) of your vrtual premier league team and you'll constantly monitor your team's performance on a weekly basis. Each player you select on your team earns points from their weekly performances in real life. Everyone is given a budget of £100m at the start of the EPL season to sign their best players.
8/3/22, 12:36 PM - +234 909 778 5164: Jotting things down
8/3/22, 12:37 PM - +234 909 778 5164: I’m still building my team 🥲
8/3/22, 12:39 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Over the course of the season, some of your players will lose form or get injured and you've buy outright or swap from your reserve players. Depending on how good your team's selections are following their week-on-week performance. The higher your team earns more points.
8/3/22, 12:40 PM - +234 703 160 7868: Don't worry you'll be fine. Just keep building. The league officially starts this weekend.🙂

8/3/22, 1:53 PM - +234 703 806 5681: Because they don't hire fresh graduates maybe
8/3/22, 1:54 PM - +234 817 511 5556: At the end of the day its job hopper they will get

Is it possible to have a table serve as a Fact table in one data model but as a dimension in a different data model (or schema)?

Comot there
8/3/22, 11:14 PM - Joe: I'm not sure if you could pass "skip this number of times" before splitting to str.split 

What I think might work is

Splitting two times by ' ] ' and ' : ' , that should give you the message.

It's not the best solution but it should work.
8/3/22, 11:15 PM - Joe: I am assuming, date time author and message is a line
8/3/22, 11:17 PM - S+N Ayoade: Yea
8/3/22, 11:18 PM - S+N Ayoade: Should I share with you ?

This your message is very unclear 😂
8/3/22, 11:28 PM - Joe: Yes boss
