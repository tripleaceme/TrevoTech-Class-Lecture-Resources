# Whatsapp Chat Analysis
This project uses text data from a Whatsapp group to create a dashboard in **Tableau**. The data is first cleaned and transformed with **Python** and the clean data is then exported as a CSV file to **Tableau** to create a dashboard.

Having completed this tutorial, I have gained amazing skills in extracting Whatsapp text data, cleaning and transforming this data to CSV format using Python and creating awesome visuals in Tableau.
