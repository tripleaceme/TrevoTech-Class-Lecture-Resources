# Every Marketing Challenge Revolves Around These 5 Questions

## How will people become aware of your business and brand?
The reality is, your business won’t pick up real momentum and grow until you’ve mastered the “awareness” factor.

The key here is to discover the channels that your prospects and customers become aware of your business and brand. The first impression of your business or brand can come through many ways today: website, ads, marketing content, networking, public relations, referrals, social media. Successful awareness always comes from narrowly defining your ideal customer and then choosing the right channels that has their attention: eyes and ears.

Nothing happens in a business until something gets sold. But, you can’t sell a product or service no one knows about. Which means you can’t grow unless you’re building the awareness factor.

## How will people trust your business and brand?
Trust is the single most important business element and is always at the heart of every transaction and is always on trial, everyday.

How can you demonstrate that your business or brand is competent, credible, and trustworthy?

Demonstrating and building trust can be done through many tactics but here are a few:

- Be visible. Be consistent. Use the same profile picture across social networks. Because familiarity breeds trust.
- Create and share content that solves your readers’ problems.
- Develop case studies and success stories, because your business or brand track record will shape their opinion.
- Ask questions. Answer queries. Say thank you.
- Admit freely if you don’t know an answer. Nobody expects you to know everything.

## How do people sample your business and brands brilliance?
This is a strategic marketing question that many neglect. Although you may have created the perfect solution there are times when people need a date before committing to the entire purchase.

It’s essential that you find ways for people sample your products or expertise. You can do this by creating a try before your buy option, creating an unheard of guarantee, a low cost version, creating a free or low cost experience of your knowledge or expertise through an 30-minute consultation, audit or evaluation or presenting educational seminars.

Building trust is such an essential element of business success and getting your foot in the door with low barrier entry offers is one of the keys to moving people into full fledged customers.

## How do people get more out of your service or product?
For this question the focus is on keeping the experience high. Think about how you onboard new customers, show them new ways to use your solution and even give them the keys to success.

If you aren’t creating processes, content and tools that show customers how to get more out of what they just bought, you’re missing out on a big opportunity to educate at a higher level, build on trust and increase customer loyalty.

## How do we intentionally generate referrals?
If you’re not focused on creating referral motivation, one that gives you a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace, your business won’t survive long in the marketing world as we know it today.

Generating referral can happen intentionally, if you formalize the process or put a process in place to make them happen. Generating referrals today can be easy, viral, organized, automatic and profitable.

- create a team and introduce them to your customers,
- sponsor a non-profit event and incorporate your customers,
- create educational information or gift certificates
- feature your success stories in your marketing materials,
- hold customer appreciation events,
- Every time you enter a new market or develop new product or service you can use this framework as a way to make sure your organization is on the path to success.
