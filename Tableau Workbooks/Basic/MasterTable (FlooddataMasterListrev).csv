BEIJING—Flooding in southwestern China over the past week has left 44 people dead and 18 missing, and caused damage to housing and crops, the Civil Affairs Ministry said Saturday.

Constant heavy rain since Aug. 31 has caused widespread destruction in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, as well as the megacity of Chongqing, where all but one of the deaths occurred and all of the missing were reported.

The ministry said 121,700 people had been moved to temporary shelters and put the number of collapsed or heavily damaged houses at 42,000. It estimated total damage at more than 3.3 billion yuan ($538 million).

The Yom River, taking in northern run-off at 1,400 cubic metres per second, continued to rise, while a 100-metre section of a flood wall in tambon Pak Kwae in Muang district broke and many areas of this tambon were under two-metres of water. Troops on flat-bottom boats helped evacuate residents at risk in Sri Samrong to safer ground.The situation looked unlikely to improve this weekend, as the Meteorological Department said a strong monsoon trough covering the upper part of Thailand would remain there. Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department chief Chatchai Phromloet said that the state had put flood-mitigation measures in place and he was confident the disastrous floods of 2010 would not be repeated this year. 
Many farmers in water-retention areas in Bang Ban district in Ayutthaya hastily harvested their rice paddy in a bid to prevent more flood damage by northern run-off, Tambon Bang Ban Mayor Chukiat Boonmee said. Farmer Phang Khunwan, 51, whose rice crop was not yet ripe, said he harvested the paddy out of fear that all would be lost. In Phachi and Uthai districts, villagers lamented that off-season rice paddy in flood-hit fields would be ruined if the situation didn't improve within five days.In Uttaradit's Tha Pla district, 80 homes and farmland near Huay Nam Mhan canal were flooded by forest run-off yesterday.Strong torrents destroyed a bridge, a spillway and brought down several power poles, which led to a blackout in six villages in tambon Nam Mhan. This prompted residents to prepare to evacuate, as it brought back memories of a flood in 2006 when the area was also hit by a landslide.In Angthong's Pa Moke district, flood-prone tambon Phong Pheng has again been inundated, affecting 3,000 villagers. A flood aid centre was opened yesterday, with some 200 police, Army and provincial administrators, 20 flat-bottom boats, and four Humvees deployed to assist people hit by the flood.Up North, residents and business owners in Chiang Rai's Mae Sai district moved belongings to higher ground after parts of the Thai-Myanmar border, especially the Tambon Mae Sai municipality, was hit by a 30cm flood. A flash flood also caused inundation in many parts of Muang district.In Bangkok, BMA Department of Drainage and Sewerage director Adisak Khantee reported to Sukhumbhand that the city would have heavy rain in several areas over the weekend, while seasonal seawater inflows were expected at the end of the month. Adisak said the city had prepared to handle the situation with 166 water pump stations, 217 sluice gates, and seven drainage tunnels. He said city workers had cleared almost 100 per cent of waterways and sewage pipes. A total of 520 water pumps were installed at flood-prone spots, while staff at relevant facilities were on alert.Sukhumbhand said the situation was not worrisome because the Bhumibol, Sirikit and Pa Sak Jolasid dams were still at 30-40 per cent capacity. However, he urged Adisak's office to monitor the rainfall in order to handle any flooding in a timely manner. He said the city, being more equipped than the Highway Department and the Rural Roads Department, had received the National Council for Peace and Order's permission to handle Bangkok's flood-hit roads.

It was expected to rise to 900,000 cusecs before Sunday morning.According to the FFD, breaches would have to be made at Khanki and Qadirabad as the capacity of the two barrages was a mere 800,000 cusecs.The next 24 hours are crucial as we expect breaches at Khanki and Qadirabad to save the two barrages as the fresh peak exceeds their design capacity.

SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A bus carrying more than 50 wedding guests was swept away Thursday by a flooded stream in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir and all but three of the passengers were missing, officials said.

Police officer Rajesh Kumar said the three swam to safety and told rescuers that about 50 others were trapped in the bus.

Rescuers were searching for the bus but had not been able to locate it in the gushing waters. New landslides and heavy rains blocked access to the area, Kumar said.

Officials earlier said the bus was carrying about 70 people. ""There is a lot of confusion,"" Kumar said.

The Press Trust of India news agency said the bride and bridegroom were among the missing people who were returning home from a wedding ceremony in a village in the Rajouri region, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir.

The region's wedding season has been disrupted by heavy rains and the worst floods in 22 years, and many ceremonies have been postponed.

At least 18 people have died in the past two days, and authorities on Thursday closed schools and stopped train services in the Kashmir valley. Meteorologists said the heavy rains were likely to continue for another two days.

Police officer Imtiyaz Hussain said the 18 victims were swept away by floodwaters or buried by mud from mountain slopes - 14 in the Jammu region and four in the Kashmir valley. They included a paramilitary officer whose bunker collapsed on him.

Soldiers and rescue workers used boats to move thousands of people to higher ground. At least 100 villages across the Kashmir valley were flooded by overflowing lakes and rivers, including the Jhelum river, which was up to 1.5 meters (4 feet) above its danger level, officials said.

Landslides and floods are common in India during the monsoon season, which runs from June through September.

Parts of Srinagar were also flooded. In Bemina, a large neighborhood, thousands of residents waded through ankle-high water that entered their homes.

Authorities evacuated 5,000 people from the neighborhood and 100 others were believed to be stranded there.

Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both. They have fought three wars, two of them over control of Kashmir, since winning independence from Britain in 1947.  ....Flood alert sounded in Srinagar as Jhelum swells

A flood alert was sounded in Srinagar city on Thursday as river Jhelum was flowing four feet above the danger mark after incessant rain, while 23 villages have been inundated by floods in south Kashmir districts of Anantnag and Kulgam.


Incessant rain over the past three days has wreaked havoc in many parts of the Valley with south Kashmir’s Anantnag and Kulgam districts the worst-hit.

“Flood alert has been sounded in Srinagar city and all emergency services have been pressed into service to meet the eventuality of a flood,” Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar, Farooq Ahmad Shah said.

He said the Jhelum at Ram Munshi Bagh in the city was flowing at 22 feet, which is four feet above the danger mark. Two persons were washed away at Aboora in Budgam district on Wednesday while nearly 100 persons trapped in flood waters in south Kashmir were evacuated to safety. September  September

News,35999.91,,,20/08/2014,,Monsoon Rain,Bangladesh,,20/08/2014,17,Northern Bangladesh,500000,20,08/09/2014,0,24.5661,90.6333,1,1,6.033422670,Monsoonal Rain,,"DHAKA, 2 September 2014 (IRIN) - Floods triggered by two weeks of intense rain have affected two million people in northern Bangladesh and left up to half a million homeless. While the country’s disaster response capacity has been enhanced in recent years, experts argue that with people displaced and crops destroyed the flooding is testing response mechanisms.

""Improvement has been made in regard to flood forecasting system but there is still lack of coordination among government agencies,"" Mahbuba Nasreen, director of the Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies at Dhaka University, told IRIN. 

A 31 August situation report by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief said 17 of the country’s 64 districts have been affected. Six of these districts are expected to experience rising water levels this week, and Dhaka, the capital and home to 15 million people, may see flooding as well.

NGOs estimate that the floods have left 500,000 homeless and, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP), “others, who have nowhere else to go, have remained in their flooded homes.”

Nasreen explained that part of the remaining weakness is due to Bangladesh’s Water Development Board being responsible for building and repairing embankments, which protect against floods, while the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief is responsible for reacting to disasters. This, she argued, results in lack of coordination between the two agencies.

""One organization should look after the whole thing,"" she said. ""There are still lots of things to do to improve [the] country's disaster response.""

Immediate relief

According to government figures, 17 people have died due to drowning in the floods, and there have been 506 cases of pneumonia, 1,850 cases of diarrhoea and 540 cases of skin infections.

Residents in the affected districts told IRIN they were worried both about the short- and long-term consequences of the flooding as they struggled to find dry ground and watched their crops get washed away.

Abdul Mannan, a father of four and farmer in Pikan Village in Rangpur District, said: “Most of my lands are being inundated. I don’t know how can I manage basic things for my family in the coming days.”

Christa Räder, WFP representative in Bangladesh, told IRIN the agencies’ assistance has focused on the distribution of nutritious biscuits, which do not require cooking. “Since 24 August WFP has reached more than 50,000 people with nutritious biscuits in the flood- and river erosion-affected districts of the north,” she said, explaining that many people have fled their flood-hit homes and are now living on higher ground or embankments, without stoves or cooking utensils.

“This immediate food assistance is important as in the initial period after a flood people have no means to cook and depend on our ready-to-eat assistance,” she said, adding: “There are many more displaced people in the flood-affected areas who have not yet received immediate assistance.”

Fewer deaths

Some indicators suggest Bangladesh’s disaster response capacity has improved in recent years. While 17 people have died in this year’s floods, a similar round of flooding in 2007 killed 1,110 people, a flood in 1998 killed 1,050, and a flood in 1988 killed 2,379.

The government has modernized its Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, which now gives up-to-date flood forecasting five days in advance (as opposed to an earlier threshold of three days), as well as information online and to people who call in.

Long-term concerns

Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, executive direct of the NGO Coast Trust, told IRIN the government’s response must also consider long-term relief measures.

Floods in Bangladesh have become less deadly, but millions affected still

“We urge government to provide shelters to the homeless families, to provide food supply until next March as they have lost the aman [main rice] crops, and double the various safety net programmes for the affected and marginalized, especially for the fishermen families, women- and child-headed households,” he said, referring to the government’s various “safety net” allowances for older people, widows, and people with disabilities, among others.

Floods in eastern Bangladesh in 2012 left thousands food insecure as water remained for prolonged periods and damaged crops severely.

According to Oxfam’s Bangladesh country director Snehal Soneji, this year’s flooding is also damaging agricultural land.

“The main crops aman and aush [the two main rice crops], jute and vegetables are completely damaged as most of the fields are under water for the last 17 days. Damage of main agriculture adversely affects livelihoods of the farmers in long run,” he said.

Other evidence points to infrastructure damage that will have short- and long-term impacts.

“A large number of hand tube-wells are estimated to have been contaminated by flood waters, forcing the affected population to seek alternative water sources,” the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and International Federation of the Red Cross warned in a statement. “With the shortage of safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities, the risk of diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases remain high.”

“Safe drinking water, hygiene kit, sanitation, cash-for-food are among the immediate needs at the time,” Soneji said, adding that Oxfam has provided hygiene kits to 600 households.

Meanwhile, Bangladesh’s disaster management and relief minister, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, insisted on a visit to affected areas that the government was responding effectively.

Over a thousand villages are flooded in nine districts of east UP. As many as 31 people have died and about half a million are affected by the floods aggravated by the unannounced release of waters from Nepal. The worst-hit district in UP is Bahraich, which is cheek by jowl with Nepal. Over 200 villages are virtually submerged under water and lakhs have been displaced in this remote eastern UP district which has recorded the maximum number of deaths (15) due to floods. Official sources say Army helicopters have been dropping food packets in the affected villages there.

What is worse is that electricity supply to this vast swathe of eastern UP has been cut off so that no one gets electrocuted. If that was not bad enough, things are expected to get worse with the Met officials predicting heavy rainfall in UP's eastern parts in the coming days.

Shravasti, Balrampur, Sitapur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Gonda, Barabanki, Faizabad and Azamgarh are the other districts in the state that have been badly affected by the floods.

""We are doing our best to reach relief to the affected people,"" UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan told dna. He said at least six lakh hectares of land had been affected and over 600 houses had been washed away. So far, 17,000 villagers have been rescued and efforts are on to reach remote areas surrounded by flood waters, he added. The state government has released Rs51 crore as relief for the flash flood-hit districts, Ranjan informed.

The Centre has issued an ""unprecedented flood situation"" warning for the Rapti, which is flowing above the danger mark in eastern UP. It threads through densely populated parts of the state.

Chief revenue officer, Bahraich, Uday Shankar described the floods as unprecedented. ""This is after 20 years that such floods are being seen in this district. The sudden release of water from Nepal gave no time to the villagers to prepare for evacuation. Many link roads and the main road connecting Bahraich to Shravasti are cut off. Most of the area is flooded due to the bloated Saryu,"" he said.

TV visuals show cattle, children and elders standing on embankments, swimming through flooded villages, marooned atop their submerged houses or being ferried by boats along with their bedding and gunny bags of wheat and grass.

A senior irrigation department official said despite relief work on a war-footing 60 villages of Bahraich were still inaccessible. Helicopters have been dropping food packets there, he said.

In Barabanki, the Ghaghra is dangerously on the rise. District magistrate Yogeshwar Ram Mishra said though the situation here was not as bad as in Bahraich, as many as 70 more villages here were affected on Sunday and 25 of them have completely been evacuated, with people living in tents at embankments with their families and cattle. ""We are trying to evacuate villages and no deaths have occurred here till now,"" he said.

UP chief secretary blames Nepal
UP chief secretary Alok Ranjan has squarely blamed Nepal for the flash floods in eastern UP districts. ""Rivers like Rapti and Ghaghra were over flowing because of excess release of water from Nepal. While the Rapti was over flowing because authorities in Bhalubang, Bhairahwa and Kusum barrages in Nepal released excess water, the Ghagra has swollen due to release of flood waters from Chisapani barrage in Nepal. The other terai rivers in spate are Saryu and Sharda,"" he told dna on Monday.
Ranjan said engineers of the irrigation department were monitoring the situation round the clock lest more fresh areas were inundated. The Nepal authorities never informed their UP counterparts in advance, he said, adding, ""this could have given us some time to evacuate the villagers in time.""
He said para-military forces had been pushed into service and Army had been asked to stand by. The UP government has called in Army choppers for rescue work while a team of NDRF has been rushed from Varanasi to Bahraich. Around 5,000 people were rescued by the PAC and NDRF teams, Ranjan said.

River levels have increased after several days of heavy rain in the state and in the rivers’ catchment areas in Nepal. At least 65 people have died in floods in Nepal over the last few days. After days of torrential rain in Nepal, it was inevitable that authorities there would need to open barrages to release excess water and ease pressure on dams. This has since increased river levels in Uttar Pradesh.

According to the Times of India the barrages at Bhalubang, Bhairahwa and Kusum, as well as Chisapani, were opened some time between 15 and 16 August 2014.

River levels in Uttar Pradesh were already swollen by the heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the Himalayas. Since opening the barrages, the Rapti and Ghaghara rivers in Uttar Pradesh have both flooded, affecting around 300,000 people across 6 districts. Levels of the Sarayu and Sharda rivers are also dangerously high.

So far the districts affected are Bahraich, Shrawasti, and Lakhimpur Kheri, which have all been flooded by the Rapti river, and Barabanki, Siddharth Nagar and Faizabad, which have been inundated by the overflowing Ghaghara river.

There are some disturbing reports that as many as 300 people are missing across the two districts of Bahraich and Lakhimpur Kheri. District authorities fear the worst.

Latest new reports say there are still 136 people missing in the floods and that the death toll now stands at 101, Relief Operations, Nepal’s National Emergency Operation Center are carrying out rescue and relief operations for the victims of the recent floods that have affected much of western Nepal, Food and drink has been distributed to over 17,000 families spread across the districts of Surkhet, Dang, Banke, Bardiya and Salyan. The Nepal authorities are also working with local Red Cross volunteers to distribute medicine, clothing and blankets.

Many roads have been blocked by landslides and flood debris, making it difficult to reach many of the flooded villages. Work is under way to repair or clear roads and bridges.

The relief operation includes use of helicopters to deliver food, emergency supplies, medicine and medical workers to the affected areas. The helicopters have also been used to evacuate 100s of people from the worst affected areas.

China's Meteorological Administration reported that it was the strongest typhoon southern China had experienced in forty years. And it had already killed 94 people in the Philippines several days before it reached China.
The storm first made landfall in Wengtian Town of Wengchang City on Hainan Island with wind speeds at an estimated 216 km/h (134 mph) and had a devastating effect. It was reported that 90% of residential buildings were destroyed by the powerful storm. Rammasun also caused floods, and mudslides throughout the area.
Hainan experienced damage to electricity and telecommunications, and water supplies have been cut off in some parts of the island. Debris blocking roads caused disruption to relief efforts, but power is being restored to some of the affected cities, such as Haikou; the capital of Hainan Province.
The storm moved further northwest and made a second landfall in China at Fangchanggang in Guanxi Province on 19 July. It caused more damage along coastal cities and air and rail services were suspended until conditions improved.
The typhoon weakened to a tropical depression on 20 July, after moving north and inland over China. It also passed over northern Vietnam, bringing heavy rain and flooding.

Odisha Update:

3 bodies have been found in Bargarh district, Odisha. The bodies were in a car that was swept away in flood waters on Monday 21 July 2014. It is thought the driver was attempting to cross a bridge over the swollen Uttali river. There is also thought to have been a fourth passenger, although authorites are yet to recover a body.

The recovery of the 3 bodies brings the death toll of the recnet floods in Odisha to 6.

Original Report from 23 July 2014

Monsoon rain has brought deadly floods the central and eastern parts of India over the last few days, killing at least 5 people with 2 still missing.

Two deaths occurred in the state of Chhattisgarh, where around 300 villages have been flooded. Three people died in flooding in the neighbouring state of Odisha after rivers overflowed.

Chhattisgarh

Two days of heavy rain in the state of Chhattisgarh has left over 300 villages under water. Over 350mm of rain fell in just 48 hours, bringing the July total to 422.5mm. Further rainfall has been forecast for the state.

The worst affected districts are Gariyaband, Mahasamund, Kanker and Bastar. Two people have died as a result of the flooding, one in Mahasamund and another in Kanker where the Kotri river overflowed. Other rivers, including Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati and Doodh have also burst their banks.

Odisha

Local media reports claim around 200 villages have suffered from flooding in the state of Odisha over the last few days, affecting over 50,000 people. Four days of heavy monsoon rain between 18 and 22 July 2014 increased rivers to danger levels and many have burst their banks. Jharsuguda saw 103mm of rain in 24 hours on 21 July. The worst affected areas are the districts of Jajpur, Keonjhar, Kalahandi and Bhadrak.

Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) and National Disaster Response Force have evacuated 15,000 people from the districts of Jaipur, Keonjhar and Bhadrak. Three people died in the floods, and another 2 are still missing in Kaptipada in Mayurbhanj district.

The most recent indications are that flood water in some areas has started to recede. Earlier today Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) said that levels of major rivers including Mahanadi, Kushabhadra, Baitarani, Budhabalang, Subarnarekha and Vansdhara were now below danger level. Levels of the Devi, Brahmani, Subarnarekha, Vansadhara and Rusikulya rivers are still above flood stage however.


The unfortunate location of Odisha leaves it vulnerable to floods from both tidal and river floods. The states coastla regions are regularly hit by cyclones and storm surges. The state’s rivers frequently overflow after heavy monsoon rainfall either in the state itself or further upriver.

Odisha suffered flooding from the fall out of cyclone Phailin in October last year when heavy rain caused the Baitarani, Budha Balanga and Subernarekha rivers to overflow. Earlier in the year, heavy monsoon rainfall had resulted in floods which affected around 250,000 people, mostly in the northern parts Odisha. Three people were reported as killed in flood related events.""",1,0,4165,1,150,74,3633,1086,News

PRESS RELEASE

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — The UN refugee agency and its partners have begun distributing urgently needed food to thousands of South Sudanese in flooded camps in western Ethiopia's Gambella region.

But humanitarian aid workers face major challenges providing assistance. The floods are also affecting the border crossings at Matar and Pagak and the Kule and Tierkidi camps, with many refugees making their way to drier ground.

In Leitchuor and Nip Nip, which together hold some 50,000 people, the continuing heavy rains have destroyed traditional shelters (tukuls) and temporary structures and forced refugees to move to higher ground, near the host community. UNHCR and the government have started to look at possible new sites where they can relocate the most vulnerable.

A rapid needs assessment, conducted last week by an inter-agency team, including UNHCR, found that both refugees and locals need food and water above all else. The situation is most serious at Nip Nip, because the floodwaters have made the road impassable and water tankers cannot reach the camp.

Based on the results of the needs assessment, the World Food Programme, with help from the government's refugee agency and UNHCR, has distributed general food rations, including sorghum, lentils and cooking oil. UNHCR is also distributing tents, plastic sheets, sleeping mats and hygiene and sanitation items in unflooded areas of Leitchuor and Nip Nip.




UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations working at the two camps are looking at the most effective ways to distribute more relief supplies, including water purification tablets, and how to help people access mobile health and nutrition clinics.

The refugee agency is also helping to step up mass information campaigns for the refugees, to give them daily updates on services available, the flood situation and advice on how to prevent outbreaks of disease.

The rains and floods pose serious public health threats because latrines and sanitation facilities have been destroyed. Malaria, Hepatitis E and cholera are the biggest threats. Médecins Sans Frontières completed a mass oral cholera vaccination campaign over the weekend in Gambella with help from UNHCR, the government and others.

More than 190,000 refugees have fled from South Sudan to Ethiopia, almost all of them to Gambella, since conflict flared last December, bringing the total number of South Sudanese refugees to more than 250,000........Sudan Floods Death Toll Rises to 77

The flooding has destroyed the temporary shelters that housed the displaced. Conditions are said to be extremely poor inside the camp – some have to sleep in flooded tents or shelters – but residents are reluctant to leave for higher ground outside the safety of the camp perimeter. Latrines and food supplies have also been damaged, causing grave concern among the relief agencies working in the camp.

Sudan Famine. Kampala — Internally displaced people (IDPs) in South Sudan's Unity state held a demonstration on Saturday, calling on the UN mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) to improve facilities at a protection site after heavy flood waters washed out temporary shelters at the camp.

Many of the victims and relatives of those sheltering at the Rubkotna camp have been sharing disturbing pictures on Facebook showing the damage caused by flooding.

A UN staff member working in the area who spoke on condition of anonymity told Sudan Tribune that the camp had been inundated by flood waters over the past four days.

He confirmed the demonstration over problems facing displaced people at the camp.

He told Sudan Tribune the situation had become dire as heavy rain continues to fall in the area, describing the situation for displaced people at the Rubkotna camp as life threatening.

""Yesterday (Saturday) I witness a woman giving birth in such [a] terrible situation, but lucky enough she was rushed to hospital in the UN and all went fine with her delivery,"" he said.

He has called on UNMISS to immediately step in to help prevent further flooding in the low-lying area, warning that the situation continued to go from bad to worse for residents at the camp.

SLEEPLESS NIGHTS

Maliah Ter, one of the displaced people sheltering at the UNMISS camp, says she hadn't slept for four days after heavy rain dislodged her family from shelters.

""We were sleeping in water for those having beds and those without beds kept standing the whole day and night because they have nowhere to go,"" Ter said in an interview with Sudan Tribune on Sunday. The situation has sparked fears of an outbreak of waterborne diseases.

Some 40,000 people are currently sheltering at the Rubkotna camp, according to the UN, the majority of them lost their homes after heavy fighting erupted between rebel and government forces in both Bentiu and Rubkotna.

The warring parties have been engaged in an armed struggle since mid-December last year after political tensions within the ruling SPLM turned violent.

Unity state has been a flashpoint for violence, with the capital, Bentiu, changing hands several times at the height of the conflict.

Reports show that more civilians are amassing at the UNMISS camp every day, driven out of their hiding places in the bush by hunger.

Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe unless the warring sides halt fighting on the ground.

Description of the Event
Torrential rain in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has caused flooding which has led to two deaths and an estimated 20,000 people evacuated.
Rio Grande do Sul is Brazil's most southern state, and borders Uruguay and Argentina. A state of emergency was declared in the state on 4 July 2014, following over a week of rain which began on 26 June. So far 115 towns and cities have been affected by the flooding across the state, which includes the state capital, Porto Allegre.
It is believed that the weather has been caused by the El Niño effect, which warms the Pacific Ocean and usually results in hot and wet summers for South America.
This latest flood follows on from another batch of torrential rain which affected southern Brazil, and particularly Rio Grande do Sul's nearby states of Santa Catarina and Paraná, in early June. The prolonged rainfall is expected to harm the area's agricultural production, due to saturated ground conditions. The Institute of Meteorology has reported that this was the wettest winter Brazil has experienced since 1983....18,400 Displaced in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil

Levels of the Uruguay River are so high in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul has declared a state of emergency for at least 131 municipalities. Declaring a state of emergency means that federal funds can be made available to local governments for aid and relief.

Torrential rain led to high river levels. The ensuing floods have displaced 18,400 people spread across the 157 towns and cities.

According to the Defesa Civil of Rio Grande do Sul, most of those who fled their homes were being sheltered by relatives and friends. Around 1,300 have been given shelter in public buildings such as sports arenas or schools.

The worst affected areas are Iraí and Barra do Guarita, mostly as a result of extremely high levels of the Uruguay River. Some local media reports claim levels have not been this high since 1983. River levels rose so rapidly few had time to prepare.///FL-2014-000083-BRA Flood Brazil Flooding had killed 10 people in southern Brazil's Parana state by 11 June 2014, and state officials declared an emergency in 130 cities.",1,Uruguay,4163,2,148,72,3631,1084,News

Posted by Richard Davies on July 14, 2014
As many as 30 villages in the Bhola District in the Division of Barisal, Bangladesh have been inundated after flood water from the overflowing Meghna River swept over broken dykes. The river levels had been swollen by recent rain fall, but also dramatically increased after a high tide on Sunday 13 July 2014.

According to local media reports, the floods have affected the upazilas (sub-districts) of Monpura and Charfashion. Houses, schools, mosques, farmland and fish enclosures have been flooded, with some areas are said to be under around 1 metre (over 3 feet of water). Transport has also been affected, particularly since many river ferry terminals and gangways are also under water.

Normally these areas are protected by a flood control dyke. The dyke in this area along the Meghna River is extremely be vulnerable to the river erosion. It is a constant battle for authorities such as the Water Development Board to repair and upgrade embankments. Large stretches of the Bhola District emabnkment collapsed last year and local residents are still awaiting its repair. Locals are blaming the current floods on the fact that no proper action has been taken to repair the dyke. It seems that poor planning meant that work to carry out repairs was only ordered as recently as last month – way too late to complete any substantial work before the rainy season.",1,0,4161,1.5,146,71,3629,1083,News

Update: 12:40 p.m.

The city and borough of Juneau has closed View Drive and all roads leading into Meander Way, from Rivercourt Drive to Killewich Avenue along Riverside Drive.

The city is asking that all non-essential persons stay out of the area, as roads may become impassible due to flooding from the Mendenhall Lake and River.

Power may be shut off to isolated areas affected by flood waters.

The city also has closed the Brotherhood Bridge Trail, including the pedestrian bridge.

“Anywhere between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. is our best guess for the peak,” says National Weather Service Meterologist Bob Tschantz.

He says people should stay away from the saturated banks of the Mendenhall River.

They get under cut by the water that’s running, and eventually the ground over the top just kind of sloughs off,” he says. “River bank erosion is a very big concern and you don’t want to be caught standing on the edge of the riverbank when it collapses into the river.”

 

Original story:

Wednesday evening’s jökulhlaup, or glacial outburst from Suicide Basin above Mendenhall Glacier, has prompted flood warnings for Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River.

As of 9:15 a.m. Friday, Mendenhall Lake was measured at 10.18 feet and Mendenhall River registered 12.1 feet, or over flood stage for both those water bodies.

The National Weather Service expects new records will be set before the Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River crest late Friday afternoon or early evening. Their forecast calls for the lake to peak at 11.99 feet, beating the previous record of 11.2 feet. The river is forecast to top out at 14.95 feet, breaking the old record of 13.8 feet.

Instead of football players, crossing the pitch is a small motorboat and passing through the goalmouth is the overflowing Rio Negro river.

The goalposts stand half submerged, now meaningless markers on an invisible field.

For more than a month, Careiro da Varzea in the Brazilian state of Amazonas has been under water in one of the worst floods on record.

It is one of almost 40 areas in Amazonas in an emergency situation or a state of calamity affecting more than 300,000 people.

Water pours through wooden bungalows in river communities, standing stagnant on the floors of their homes, bringing waterborne diseases and making access difficult without a boat.

Since the end of last year, heavy rains have pushed the Rio Negro, which flows into the Amazon, to emergency levels.

Meanwhile, the biggest tributary of the Amazon, the Rio Madeira, reached record heights and caused the worst flooding for a century across more remote parts of north-west Brazil and northern Bolivia.

Experts say the water is expected to remain until the middle of July before eventually subsiding, leaving those who live on the river to rebuild their vulnerable homes.

""We consider a situation to be extreme when the river reaches the emergency level,"" explains Marco Antonio de Oliveira, who is the regional superintendent of the Brazilian Geological Service in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas.

""In this year's floods, the river reached emergency levels on 22 May. We have spent practically the whole of June above the emergency level.

""It's likely that this year, the time that the water has remained high and inside the homes of some of the poorest in Manaus will surpass 50 days.""

The Northland Rural Support trust has had an immediate response to its call for emergency feed and grazing to help flood-stricken farmers in the region.
The trust has been closely monitoring the impact of the past week's storm and prolonged rainfall, and put out the call for help on Sunday.
Co-ordinator Julie Jonker said little grazing had been offered but farmers from as far away as Manawatu had offered to send feed, which was in short supply in Northland following the drought.
""We've got a perfect storm in that we've had a drought. People often use some of their winter supplements to get them through the drought period and now, when we were hoping for a mild, not-too-wet winter, we ended up with a flood as bad as the 2007 one that we had,"" she said.
""We also had those strong winds, and there was a lot of damage to infrastructure such as cow shed roofs blowing off, calf and hay sheds damaged, so chances are some feed supplements may have been damaged as well.
""We are still trying to quantify exactly what the damage is, not only financially but to the farmers involved.""
Farmers in the flood-prone Hikurangi Swamp area, north of Whangarei, had been among the hardest hit, Ms Jonker said.
Up to 30 farms there were flooded, and at least nine more downstream at Tangiteroria.
Weeks to clear
One of the flooded Hikurangi Swamp farmers, Ben Smith, said up to 70 percent of his effective dairy farm was under water and it would take weeks for the water to clear.
""The worst of us will be three to four weeks, so we'll have dead pasture from then. Depending on how well spring treats us, we'll need eight weeks after that to get the first grazing off the pasture, so you're talking two or three months, basically,"" Mr Smith said.
Evan Sneath, a dairy farmer at Hukerenui at the top end of Hikurangi Swamp, said flood levels had dropped a little but he still had about 60ha of land under water, and he was waiting for local council approval to cut the flood banks to clear the water more quickly.
""What we're trying to do there is let the water off our land quicker so we can get back on and start getting stuff in - grass seed or whatever we're going put back into it, and also to try and keep water quality,"" Mr Sneath said.
""The longer the water sits on our farm, the water quality deteriorates rapidly and it gets to the point where, if it sits too long, there's no oxygen left in the water and, going back into the streams, it starts killing off fish life and everything.""
Mr Sneath said he would also have to replace dead pasture, and he was making arrangements to truck in supplies of hay, silage and other supplementary feed.
""I'm doing that off my own bat but I'm also going to get in touch with Rural Support to try and look for some grazing for my young stock.""
Farmers who can help with feed or grazing should contact the Northland Rural Support Trust on 0800-787-254.////Three rescued, one missing in floods

ST. LOUIS (AP) -- As the rain-swollen Mississippi River carried on its plodding retreat Friday, western Illinois farmer Joe Zumwalt wasn't complaining about the flooding that wound up swamping a hundred or two of his 3,500 river-bottom acres of corn and soybeans.

Zumwalt lost all of it just a few years ago in 2008, when two of the region's levees couldn't hold back the engorged river, ultimately submerging tens of thousands of acres of farmland.

""I think what's happened this year is proof that the levees work,"" said Zumwalt, 36. ""If you stand on the top of the levee and look at the amount of water being held back and the potential devastation that could have occurred, you have to feel pretty good.""

The economic toll of Midwest flooding - typical of this time of year - only now is trickling in.

While officials say it's too early to estimate the flood's financial cost, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency says at least 383,000 acres of crops have been destroyed and 2 million damaged in Iowa and Illinois alone due to excessive rain, flash flooding, and flooding on the Mississippi River and its tributaries.

Crop damage in Missouri has not yet been reported to the USDA, Farm Service Agency spokeswoman Isabel Benemelis said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency still is getting preliminary damage assessments from pounding upper Midwest storms that led to the flood, and from the flooding itself, spokeswoman Amanda Bicknell said.

""This is really a moving target,"" she said.

Buyouts of flood-prone property since the benchmark flood of 1993 - and newer, bigger levees - have limited damage this time around, even though this flood ranked among the 10 highest ever in several locations. Still, the flood has damaged roads and infrastructure, along with scattered homes and businesses.

The flood came at a bad time for farmers, with corn having been flourishing in the nation's midsection and soybean plants still maturing.

Around his fields near Illinois' Warsaw, Zumwalt had cause for jubilance: Crops on just 100 to 200 acres got ruined in the past week or two by Mississippi River water that weaseled its way under the levees. But the levees held, said the Hancock County Farm Bureau's president, and that's all that mattered.

""We're not talking about huge amounts of crop loss,"" he said. ""By and large, the crops in our area look very good.""

While retreating Friday in most places, the Mississippi still was 8 feet above flood stage in Grafton, Illinois, a town without a levee about 40 miles north of St. Louis. The river level there was expected to start dropping. Despite its lack of protection, damage there was minimal.

Both bridges closed by the flood have reopened. Traffic resumed Thursday afternoon at the Quincy (Illinois) Memorial Bridge. The Champ Clark Bridge at Louisiana, Missouri, was also open, but with one lane only, said Paris Ervin, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Transportation.

Impact of the Quincy bridge closing was minor because the town has two bridges. When the Louisiana bridge closed on Sunday, drivers on U.S. 54 had to go 35 miles north to Hannibal, Missouri, to cross the river.////June 25, 2014: ""CHICAGO — Minnesota was besieged on Tuesday by some of its most widespread flooding in years. Water spilled onto streets in downtown St. Paul, crops of soybeans and corn were damaged and a state of emergency was declared in 35 counties.The flooding spanned vast regions of the state, from the Canadian border to Iowa. It was the result of an unusually heavy snowpack from winter, combined with torrential rain this spring and early summer that had filled lakes and wetlands. A major storm that brought close to six inches of rain last week in parts of the state pushed the already swollen Mississippi, Crow and St. Croix Rivers to their limits.“This is severe flooding, and in many different locations in the state, which I haven’t seen before,” Gov. Mark Dayton said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “I’ve seen severe weather — tornadoes, flash floods and ice storms — but usually they impact one area of the state. This one is the whole state.”In St. Paul, the capital, the Mississippi River rose to a nearly 20-foot crest, forcing the closing of some roads. In Stillwater, drivers were diverted from a bridge that links Minnesota and Wisconsin. And in Delano, west of the Twin Cities, businesses close to the Crow River were quickly evacuated. Residents of Waterville in southern Minnesota resorted to sandbags to fight off the Cannon River.Officials expected the Mississippi River to crest in St. Paul on Thursday at 20.5 feet, the sixth-highest on record.“It’s been quite a historical flood for this area,” said Craig Schmidt, a service hydrologist for the National Weather Service. “We’ve got large, large areas of the state that are underwater. We’ve had some of our gauges hit record highs.”Weather experts said the flooding arrived unusually late in the year, leaving officials scrambling to control the high water with sandbags, flood walls and makeshift barriers.Mr. Dayton called it “a building emergency” and planned to continue traveling the state this week to visit communities and assess the damage. President Obama is expected to stop in Minnesota on Thursday for an unrelated event, and Mr. Dayton said that he intended to discuss the crisis with him.Elsewhere in the Midwest, flooding affected homes and businesses in South Dakota, Missouri and northwest Iowa. Roughly 150 homes in Iowa suffered major flood damage, officials said. The federal Department of Transportation has pledged $750,000 for the repair of flood-damaged Iowa roads.The mayor of St. Paul, Chris Coleman, declared a state of emergency there. In Newport, Minn., a small city along the Mississippi, a sand station was set up so that residents could make sandbags for their homes.Some city officials worried that infrastructure meant to protect cities from storms was hopelessly outdated.Deb Hill, the city administrator in Newport, said that a levee built more than 50 years ago to protect the town was in “terrible condition,” and only two feet from being breached.Even if it is not breached, if the water level in the river stays high, the levee could collapse from the continued pressure, she said.“Someday it will collapse,” she said. “We’re preparing for that. Will it go tomorrow or will it go 10 years from now? Everyone’s aware that it will go. It’s just all anxiety and anticipation.”
Vickie Mirenda, an owner of the Peppermint Twist Drive-In in Delano, Minn., said that her business was safely across the road from the Crow River, but that nearby businesses had shut down temporarily.Her restaurant was unusually busy on Tuesday, and customers could talk of nothing but the flooding, she said, and the storms that threatened the region.“Every time we see a black cloud, we get nervous,” Ms. Mirenda said. “I don’t know where else the water can go. We’re praying to keep the rain away.” ""Minnesota Floods Continue. Posted by Richard Davies on June 25, 2014. Levels of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers are expected to crest in the Twin Cities area over the next 2 days. The flood threat remains, in particular after further heavy rain in the north of the state yesterday. Local media say there are currently 8 state roadways or river crossings closed due to flooding across Minnesota. Governor Dayton and Minnesota’s Executive Council voted unanimously to extend the state of emergency in 35 counties of the state yesterday.
Rain in the North. Parts of northern Minnesota, including Marshall County, saw over 4 inches fall in 24 hours between 23 and 24 June 2014. The Middle River is reported to have burst its banks, affecting parts of the city of Middle River. Hastings. Meanwhile, south of the Twin Cities, the City of Hastings saw some flooding after the Mississippi broke its banks. Some roads are closed in the city, but as yet there are no reports of any damage to property.Yesterday river levels at Hastings stood at 17.85 feet, which is almost 3 feet above minor flood stage, and just under the major flood stage mark of 18 feet. However forecasters say the levels are still rising and the river is set to crest on Friday at around 19 feet.Costs. The city of St Paul claims it has spent $1.7 million on flood protection efforts since the floods first threatened around 10 days ago. In Delano, the authorities there say the flooding from the Crow River has caused around $250,000 damage already. Minnesota state has a new disaster fund of around $3 million and it is likely that federal help will be required.Iowa Floods Start to Recede. Elsewhere in the Midwest, the flood threat appears to be easing in Iowa. After something like three times the normal average rainfall last week (3.7 inches), flood water appears to be receding across much of Iowa. Although there are still many rivers with levels at flood stage, water levels are now dropping and most of the flooding is confined to roads, farmland and parks rather than homes or property."" June 20, 2014: ""NORTH SIOUX CITY, S.D. (AP) -- A swollen river that threatened homes where Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota meet crested earlier and at a lower level than expected early Friday. Minnesota officials toured waterlogged areas of that state, saying the severity and breadth of flooding make a federal disaster request a near certainty.The less-serious crest of the Big Sioux River prompted crews take down sandbags and other containers blocking a section of Interstate 29 that acted as a temporary levee to protect an at-risk South Dakota city.The road, which Lt. Gov. Matt Michels said remained dry while closed, reopened Friday afternoon. But some buildings, farmland and roads remain flooded, Michels said.""Do not drive on a road with water. It may not be there,"" he said.The National Weather Service had predicted earlier that the river would hit a record high around midday, but then said it crested at Sioux City, Iowa, around midnight a couple of feet below the previous record.
Days of thunderstorms upstream swelled the 420-mile-long river and threatened homes and businesses in the three surrounding states, including up to 400 in a neighborhood of North Sioux City, South Dakota.Craig Dam, 48, who owns Dam Auto Sales in Sioux City, Iowa, was relieved the water had started to drop. Dam spent part of Friday removing a 3-foot-high row of sandbags from the front and side of his house that friends, family, neighbors and students from a nearby high school put up on Thursday.""People just came out to help,"" he said.Had the river overtaken the interstate, the plan was for the water to flow down his street and empty into an empty lot.The change in the crest was due to a large amount of water released Tuesday night when a levee failed upstream at Akron, Iowa, said Mike Gillispie, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls.""Enough water went through the levee failure out into agricultural land there that it lowered the amount of water coming through at peak crest at Sioux City,"" he said.The river had been expected to crest at Sioux City about a foot above the 108.3-foot record set in 1969. Instead, it peaked at 105.6 feet and began dropping.As a result, the river in the Sioux City area will stay at a higher level longer than previously predicted, Gillispie said. He expects it to stay above the 99-foot flood stage, the level at which farmland around Sioux City is underwater, into Sunday or Monday.He said as long as the area doesn't get heavy rain over the next few days, the water should fall back below flood levels. While there is potential for scattered thunderstorms, he doesn't anticipate widespread rain.In Minnesota, heavy rains over several days left farm fields under water and roads washed out. Dams have failed and water has infiltrated homes. Four state parks have been fully or partially closed because of high water.""The damage is really unprecedented and very widespread,"" Gov. Mark Dayton said.In Minneapolis, a large section of mud gave way on a cliff near the Mississippi River. The slide occurred not far from a hospital near the University of Minnesota's campus. Minneapolis Assistant Fire Chief Charles Brynteson said the hospital building is set on bedrock and is sound. Two motorists accelerated to safety as the mud and debris were falling.""They very easily could have been trapped,"" he said. ""It was close.""Downstream, the Omaha Public Power District said it will reduce power as it prepares for rising water on the Missouri River.

Posted by Richard Davies on July 10, 2014
According to Julián Báez, director of Meteorología e Hidrología in Paraguay, the levels of the Paraguay River in Asuncion have now started to fall. They peaked on Tuesday 8 July 2014 at 7.35 metres, then fell by 1 cm the next day. The measurement may be small, but levels are at least falling. In the lower basin area river levels are not expected to peak for another 2 days. In Pilar, the level stands at 8.43 metres and is expected to rise further.

El Niño Could Bring Similar Floods by November

Snr. Báez also said that he expected river levels to continue declining until October or November, when the rainy season starts. Forecasters believe Paraguay will see heavy rainfall in the last 3 months of this year as a result of El Niño. In other words, we could be seeing a repeat of the mass evacuations across the country in less than 6 months.

250,000 Affected across 10 Departments

Despite falling river levels, Paraguay’s National Emergency Secretariat (La Secretaría de Emergencia Nacional – SEN) reported yesterday that the number of people affected by the flooding of the Paraguay and Parana rivers amounted to almost 250,000. Those affected are in Asuncion, and the departments of Alto Paraguay, Concepción, Presidente Hayes, Boquerón, San Pedro, Alto Paraná, Central, Ñeembucú and Misiones.////Jul 3, 4:32 PM EDT

ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguayan officials warned on Thursday of a possible environmental disaster because a flooding river is threatening a dump site for toxic residues.

State environmental chief Marina Cristina Morales said the Paraguay river already has flooded the Cateura dump in the capital city of Asuncion. The river has risen nearly 6.5 feet (2 meters) above normal, though it was still 9 feet (2.8 meters) below the level of a containment site for toxic waste.

""If the river continues to rise we will likely be facing an environmental disaster,"" Morales said.

The lower house of Congress approved declaration of an environmental emergency alert on Thursday and the Senate was expected to also approve the use of more resources, including $1 million aimed at preventing the contamination.

The flooding, after days of torrential rains, already has forced the evacuation of about 300,000 people near the Paraguay and Parana rivers. Most of them were still evacuated Thursday, sheltered in camps of improvised tents.

Paraguay's weather service forecasts that the swollen rivers will begin to slowly recede back to their normal levels by August.////June 25, 2014: ""Officials in Paraguay say floods caused by heavy rains have forced some 200,000 people across the country to leave their homes.
The country’s emergency service said Monday that an estimated 70,000 of the people who have escaped the rising waters are from the capital, Asuncion.Paraguay has seen heavy rainfall in recent weeks, which has caused the Paraguay and Parana rivers to overflow their banks.
The flooding has affected the departments of Neembucu, Alto Parana, Presidente Hayes and Alto Paraguay, as well as the municipalities of Ayolas and Asuncion. Rescue workers have set up some 60 government camps to shelter displaced families and have distributed clothes and foods among those affected by the floods.Meanwhile, the recent heavy rains have also affected Paraguay’s neighboring countries Argentina and Brazil.In Argentina, some 5,000 people have been forced out of their homes due to the flooding in the city of Formosa located at the border to Paraguay.This is while authorities in Brazil’s southern state of Santa Catarina said that the recent severe weather has caused an estimated 519 million reals (USD 233 million) in damage.In addition, the southern Brazilian state of Parana has been affected by torrential rains this month, which have caused the Iguazu River to break its banks. The flooding killed at least 13 people in the state and left thousands homeless."" June 13, 2014: ""FL-2014-000077-PRY ""..""Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina all Hit by FloodsPosted by Richard Davies on June 13, 2014
Heavy rainfall has now led to flooding in Paraguay, Brazil and parts of north east Argentina. River levels, especially those of the Paraguay and Paraná rivers are dangerously high. Some stretches of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers have already burst their banks.
Brazil
11 people have now died in the flooding in the state of Paraná, where a total of 560,000 are reported to have been affected by flooding over the last week. The state of Santa Catarina is also affected. Further heavy rainfall is expected over the next few days.
Paraguay
2 people have been reported as killed in the flooding. A boy aged 10 drowned in flood waters near the Paraná River in Misiones Department yesdterday Thursday 12 June 2014, according to local police. As many as 160,000 have been affected in the country, with many of them in the capital Asunción. Further rain is expected, along with some strong winds and cold temperatures.
Argentina
The north eastern area of Argentina that borders Paraguay and Brazil is also experiencing flooding. The province of Misiones is worst affected, in particular Montecarlo, Puerto Piraí and Caraguataí. Roads and bridges have been damaged and thousands are believed to have been cut off from the outside world as a result. Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for the next 24 hours.
Iguazu Falls
As happened during flooding around the same time last year, authorities have closed the famous Iguazu Falls to tourists while water levels are so high. The safety of walkways around the falls has been compromised and the situation is considered to be too dangerous to allow tourists to the site.
2 Months of FloodingFlooding is farily frequent in this region of South America where the 3 countries meet. In fact the situation is very similar to the 2013 flooding of the Paraná River that  affected Paraguay, Argentina and parts of Brazil. One feature of last year’s floods to bear in mind was just how long they went on for. In 2013 the flooding lasted for almost 2 months, starting in early June and continuing through to the end of July.
1982 to 1983 Floods
One of the worst floods of the Paraná river was during 1982 to 1983. The flooding affected Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. 600,000 people were displaced, and there were 170 casualties killed in the floods.
Chile
Although not directly related to the flooding of the Paraguay and Paraná rivers, Chile is also experiencing floods in central and southern regions. Around 1,600 people have been displaced, and roads have been damaged leaving some communities isolated.
Floods in the first few days of June this year left around 4,000 people stranded in central and southern Chile.The intense rains in Paraguay, which started in March 2014, have been unusually intense for the season, leading to severe floods in rural communities and urban areas. The effects have continued to be felt with the flooding from the rapidly rising Paraná river and Paraguay river. To date, 39,000 families (195,000 people) from five departments in the country have been affected by the flooding and require humanitarian support. The most recent rains registered in the upper basin of the Iguazú river have led to the overflowing of this riverbed and the subsequent increase of water levels in the Paraná river. This has led to the increase in the amount of water in the reservoir of the Itaipú and Yacyreta dams, which has required both dams to increase their water flow which in some cases has reached between 22,000 m?/s and 43,000 m?/s. As a consequence, the impact has been extreme for the riverside populations located in Alto Paraná, Misiones and Ñeembucú.

Posted by Richard Davies on June 10, 2014A state of emergency has been declared in over 70 municipalities in the southern Brazilian state of Paraná after heavy rainfall across the state led to widespread flooding. The neighbouring state of Santa Catarina has also been affected.Some reports claim the flooding has struck in at least 70 towns and cities in Paraná, including Campo Largo, Cascavel, Cruz Machado, Mallet, Pinhão, Reserva do Iguaçu and São Matheus do Sul, as well as the capital and World Cup host city of Curitiba. Although so far it seems Curtiba has been spared the worst, areas of the city including Uberaba, Cajuru, Boqueirão, Tatuquara and Santa Felicidade have seen some flooding and there are still fears that the two rivers in the city may overflow.Around 3,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, displacing over 7,000 people. Bridges and roads have been washed away in the floods, and the military have been called in to carry out rescue missions and evacuations.Local authorities say that at least 9 people have died in the flooding.

""Asunción (Agenzia Fides) - At least 40 000 people have suffered serious damage due to the flooding which recently struck the western region of El Chaco, in Paraguay. According to data on behalf of the Secretariat for National Emergency (SNE), the heavy rains in the last 3 weeks which have fallen on this area of the South American country have caused the overflowing of the Pilcomayo River in the neighboring regions of Argentina, causing drownings in the center of El Chaco and isolating thousands of local families with their livestock. Currently 10 000 families are surrounded by water or are their homes are completely flooded and, given the negative forecasts for the next few days, it is feared that they could be become 40 000. This is the worst flood recorded in the area over the last 15 years. The district of Loma Plata, in the heart of the region, is one of the areas most seriously affected. Lack of food, drinking water and electricity. The SNE, the main government agency for assistance to the population in cases of natural disasters, will send about 44 000 pounds of food, clothing and plastic tents. The relief efforts have been made more difficult by the interruption of flooded roads. There are 3 000 supplies for the thousands of families who have suffered injuries, many of whom are temporarily in a shelter set up by SNE.

HydroWorld.com reported in February that more than 4,500 residents in areas downstream from Tokwe-Mukosi had been evacuated following heavy rains in Zimbabwe's Masvingo province after water began leaking through cracks in the dam's walls.
According to The Financial Gazette's report, French design firm Coyne et Bellier was first commissioned to provide a study for the dam and a hydropower plant in Fall 1967.
The idea was tabled during decades of political unrest before being resurrected in 1980, with Coyne et Bellier providing further studies in the mid-1980s. The group then proposed a concrete arch dam in 1992, though the design was changed after being deemed too expensive by the Zimbabwe government.
""[The design] was considered excessive and so the Designs Division of the Department of Water Development began a thorough investigation into the Coyne et Bellier design report and came up with a cheaper alternative in the form of a concrete-faced rock-filled dam,"" said a report released in 1998 -- the same year in which construction of Tokwe-Mukosi finally began.

“Co-operative governance and traditional affairs' provincial disaster management centre (PDMC), together with emergency management services (EMS), are working round the clock to respond and offer aid in affected areas,” said PDMC head Elias Sithole.
The most affected areas in the province were the City of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni.Temporary accommodation, food parcels and blankets were provided to people displaced by the floods.“About 70 shacks in the Vusimuzi informal settlement near Tembisa, in Ekurhuleni, were flooded, and about 25 displaced families were moved to the community hall,” Sithole said.The PDMC and the municipal disaster management centre (MDMC) in the area had also cleared flooded roads and school yards in the municipality.
“Blocked stormwater drainages were unblocked and the dammed water was able to flow, relieving the flooded roads.”
About 90 shacks in Kliptown, Soweto, had also been flooded due to heavy rains in the area.“About 200 community members had to be accommodated in the community hall and the PDMC provided blankets to the affected Kliptown community members,” Sithole said.The MDMC would remain on high alert over the weekend because the heavy rain was expected to continue.Human settlements, co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Ntombi Mekgwe urged people to avoid flood-prone areas.

Some of the shacks had been washed away, and small tracts of land were waterlogged. The narrow paths around the shacks were submerged and residents had to step on bricks to get into their homes.A pensioner, who didn’t want to be named, lost his ID book, his state pension card and antiretrovirals.He said the water level in the low-lying area where his shack is situated was waist deep.

Mofokeng said about 50 people, many of them children, slept in the hall.For Josephina Mokoena, getting to the hall, which is within walking distance from her shack, was too much of a struggle.The pensioner, who lives with her three grandchildren, lay on a single mattress on the muddy floor in her shack.The bottom half of her kitchen cupboards had been submerged in the floods.“That’s where the water came up to,” she said, lying on her mattress covered with a floral blanket smeared with mud.“My body’s sore and I’ve got chest pains… maybe I’ll go to the clinic tomorrow.”Mofokeng said it was always the same families whose shacks lay below the floodline that were affected by torrential rain.She added that plans were under way to move them to a safer area.Meanwhile, in Limpopo, heavy rains left at least one family in a crisis after a woman and her husband went missing on Friday.Sarah Viljoen and her husband Eric Sparrow were washed away after a nearby dam overflowed, swamping their indoor swimming pool at Kariba Lodge in Bela-Bela.A search team spent the weekend trying to find the elderly couple.

Hence it is likely that the levels of those rivers will fall.“We must continue to monitor the northern and central zones because of the continuing heavy rains.

The Jakarta administration and its neighboring districts announced various plans and projects, which are already operational or planned to be implemented, in order to deal with the inundation problem.Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, recently claimed that the capital city has built 1,900 absorption wells, while around two million wells are, in fact needed, to curb flooding.Out of 884 sewers and small rivers existing in the city, his administration has managed to clean up just 160 of them. Jokowi stated that he also plans to return the upstream area of the Ciliwung River in Puncak, Bogor, West Java, to its natural habitat as a water catchment area to prevent flooding in Jakarta, since the floodwaters mostly arise from the Bogor District.""The floodwaters have indeed come here (Jakarta) from the area above (the upstream area of Ciliwung river). That is what needs to be overcome. The root problem lies there,"" he recently noted.The governor further explained that the citys public works office will focus on constructing river dikes, since one of the main factors that triggered the floods so far, are the weak condition of the dykes. ""Therefore, this year, the public works office will focus on constructing dikes along the river banks,"" he emphasized, while inspecting a dike on the banks of the Ciliwung River.A new dike is being built on the western side of the Ciliwung River to curb floods and robs. On the occasion, Jokowi planted four trees along the Ciliwung River.

Thirty-two out of 77 provinces have experienced flooding since mid-September and 23 people have been killed, the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department said in a report, adding that 25 provinces still have flooding.

In 2011, Thailand suffered its worst flooding in half a century. More than 800 people were killed and 6 million hectares (14.8 million acres) of agricultural, industrial and residential lands were devastated. Many of the country's industrial estates, which export electronic parts, auto parts and hard disk drives, were swamped, as were large parts of Bangkok.
Authorities have downplayed concerns of a repeat.

But flood defences and evacuation warnings meant that only two people were killed in storm-related accidents.Accidents linked to the storm that roared across Europe have killed at least eight people, from Britain to Sweden, Denmark and Poland.Traffic ground to a halt on icy highways and train service was cancelled in large parts of Sweden. Tens of thousands of people lost electricity. Strong winds knocked down the city of Vaxjo's Christmas tree.Scores of flights were cancelled at airports in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Poland. More than 1000 people spent the night at Copenhagen Airport where 200 flights were cancelled Thursday and about 70 on Friday.Strong winds threatened a collection of Viking ships recovered from the bottom of a Danish fjord in the 1960s and put on exhibition.Museum workers boarded up the expansive windows of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, west of Copenhagen, amid fears water from the fjord would rise and shatter the glass.Police in Denmark ordered the evacuation of people in the towns of Frederikssund and Frederiksvaerk, northeast of Copenhagen, because of imminent flooding. The towns lie on the Roskilde fjord, which has seen water levels rise noticeably.Hamburg Airport, where almost all flights were cancelled on Friday, was open for business but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow.Trains northward from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled.Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory. But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days have meant the impact of this week's storm on the city has been negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life.Meanwhile, wind farms in Germany reaped benefits from the storm.

The most recent death toll stands at more than 100 and it is estimated that over 100,000 livestock have been lost, threatening the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people.The Somali Red Crescent Society mobilized its volunteers to evacuate people to safer ground and to provide first aid services. Volunteers are also collecting and burying dead livestock in an effort to stave off the breakout of disease.
As water levels began receding and roads became passable, the Somali Red Crescent Society dispatched two mobile health clinics and an additional vehicle to support rescue operations.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is also stepping in to assist with emergency response efforts.

""IFRC has deployed a team to assist the Somali Red Crescent to carry out assessments and initial response in the northeast area of Puntland,"" said Kwame Darko, health delegate for IFRC's Somalia delegation.

""We also sent in non-food items such as kitchen sets, tarpaulins, blankets, sleeping mats, jerry cans and soap, initially for 100 families. We will increase this based on the assessment results.""

With fears of an outbreak of waterborne diseases, the IFRC will also deploy a water and sanitation specialist from the Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT), as well as a health specialist from the Somali Red Crescent to take part in the assessment mission. The full RDRT remains on stand-by to be deployed to Puntland and Somaliland if needed.

This week's efforts will be concentrated in carrying out assessments in the eight most affected districts in the Nugal and Bari regions. Relief items will then be distributed based on the needs of affected families.

This cyclone is just one of the many silent disasters occurring around the world, most of which usually go unreported in international media and are often out of the public eye, failing to attract sufficient funding and resources to provide essential humanitarian aid.

AUSTIN – It's a Halloween nightmare that won't go away.Tirso Perez awoke to find shin-high water streaming into his living room. Outside, walls of water washed over his street and rolled into his lawn.A week later, Perez's neighborhood and many others are still reeling from the flooding as residents and volunteers dig out from the mud-caked destruction.After propping up his two Chihuahuas – Chico and Gizmo – on a bed, Perez, 76, and his wife, Maria, 72, pushed their way to their front lawn and into waist-high water. It was the beginning of a harrowing three-hour ordeal that ended with rescue crews in a boat plucking the pair from a neighbor's roof.""I've lived here 30-something years and never seen anything like that,"" said Perez, a retired state worker.This week, residents tried to locate tool sheds, cars and pets that floated miles away in the flood. Others pulled soggy sheetrock from homes.Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell declared a local state of disaster Monday.The neighborhoods near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport were overwhelmed in the early morning hours of Oct. 31 when water from nearby Onion Creek surged past its banks and rolled into their streets, filling homes within minutes.They were caught in a historic flash flood with more force and volume of water than the city has ever seen. The flood killed at least four people – including a woman and her 8-month-old son who were swept away in their car – damaged more than 1,200 homes and sent hundreds of residents fleeing to higher ground.A torrential rainstorm that stalled over a limestone watershed prone to flash floods led to the flooding, said Wendy Morgan, a city spokeswoman. Onion Creek rose 11 feet in 15 minutes and crested at a record 41 feet, sending walls of water into surrounding neighborhoods. The previous record for Onion Creek, set in 1869 and again in 1921, was 38 feet, Morgan said.The recent flood had a flow rate of 120,000 cubic feet per second – nearly twice the force of Niagara Falls, she said.""It was flattening trees. It was moving boulders. It was pushing cars around like they were pieces of paper,"" Morgan said. ""It was a huge volume of water. There was no standing up to this flood.""""I'm still in shock,"" said Carmen Perez, Tirso Perez's daughter, who lost a home on the same street as her father. ""It all happened within 15 minutes. It was that fast.""Immediately after the flood, the American Red Cross of Central Texas opened two shelters that accepted 60 displaced residents, said Jose Dominguez, a spokesman with the group. That number has since dwindled to 45, he said. The Red Cross has not received any state or federal funding, he said.""The biggest need right now is permanent housing,"" Dominguez said. ""It happened in the middle of the night. People didn't expect to be woken up to such devastation.""The water started to flow into neighborhoods around 5 a.m. Oct. 31 and intensified until around 10 a.m., Morgan said. The water came on so hard and fast that it overwhelmed two river sensors in Onion Creek, she said. Emergency response teams were dispatched to manually measure the rising water.Earlier that morning, the National Weather Service had issued a flash flood emergency warning for the area — the first one Austin has ever received, she said.""We knew we had a record flood coming,"" Morgan said. ""What surprised us was the volume of water.""Emergency officials were thrown off because they had endured a drought for so long, said Toni Grasso, another Austin spokeswoman. ""It overwhelmed our resources,"" Grasso said of the flood. ""No one anticipated this.""Viola Brown was asleep the morning of the flood when a neighbor called to say water was rising against her front door. She should come to the neighbor's two-story home, the neighbor said.Brown, 70, packed her glasses, keys and a change of clothes into a plastic bag and headed to the neighbor's house. Halfway there, a surge of water knocked her down. She crawled to a stop sign, stood and held on for the next three hours, singing church hymns and praying as the water rose to her chest, she said.""I thought, 'This will pass soon,'"" Brown said. ""But it didn't.""Instead, the current strengthened, ferrying branches, uprooted trees and the tops of submerged cars past her, she said. Dogs and deer paddled frantically in the dark water around her.Finally, an Austin police helicopter spotted her and lowered a rescue worker on a cable to her. He wrapped her in an emergency lifesaver and hoisted her to the helicopter, which flew her to higher ground. For now, Brown sleeps on an air mattress at a Red Cross shelter. She's debating whether to try to rebuild her home or move to Houston with family members. Mostly, she's happy to be alive, she said.""God brought me through that,"" Brown said.

Last year, the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu was affected by the overflowing of the Vilcanota River and had to closed to the public for two months so that the train line leading to it, which had been damaged by flooding, could be repaired.
Officials, however, so far have not said that they are going to have to take measures of this kind at Machu Picchu, which this year will celebrate the 100th year of its discovery.Fifty towns in Ancash located on the so-called Huaylas and Conchucos routes have been rendered incommunicado by several mudslides that buried the roads this past week, emergency management officials told the El Comercio newspaper.In Ancash, one of the country’s main tourist attractions, the snow-covered Pastoruri mountain has reduced its schedule for visits by mountaineers to just the morning hours because of the presence later in the day of electrical storms and heavy rain.Meanwhile, in the region of Huanuco, the overflowing of the Pachitea River has left 550 people affected in the Yuyapichis district, in the province of Puerto Inca, because of the flooding of 110 homes, as well as an unknown number of crop fields.In the region of Pasco, at least 65 communities in the districts of Puerto Bermudez and Ciudad Constitucion remain under water after the overflowing of the Pichis River, emergency management officials said.The intense rains have prevented the operation of helicopters in the area to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid, forcing the emergency management office to send some 25 tons of food, clothing, and construction materials by land.There are 5,000 people affected in Pasco between those who lost their homes and all their possessions and others who suffered more minor damage, but all of them need food and medical attention to prevent the spread of disease, officials said..""",1,0,4097,1.5,85,40,3568,1052,News

Over 2.5 lakh people have been marooned in Balasore, which along with Mayurbhanj, are the worst-hit.
Here are the latest developments: 
The situation in Balasore ""is critical,"" according to PK Mohapatra, the state's Special Relief Commissioner, as flood waters from the Budhabalanga and Subarnarekha rivers inundated scores of villages.
Nearly half of Baripada town in the neighbouring Mayurbhanj district has also been submerged due to a worrying rise in water levels in the river.
Teams from the Army, Navy and Air Force, besides central disaster management agencies, have been deployed for rescue and relief operations in region. ""We are starting air-dropping of food packets in Balasore district immediately...

The death toll in the state due to the impact of the cyclone has risen to 27 after four people were killed today due to the floods in Mayurbhanj and Bhadrak districts.
Three villages in Ganjam district, which bore the maximum brunt of the monster storm which hit the state on Saturday evening, have also been completely submerged, stranding nearly 10,000 people. A local MLA in the district has, in fact, demanded for the Army and Air Force to be called in to evacuate people. (Track updates)
Power services in Ganjam have been completely wrecked, while five lakh homes have been partially or completely destroyed. ""It will take us a minimum of one week, maybe even two weeks to get power back,"" collector of Ganjam district Krishan Kumar said.
The loss arising out of the devastation unleashed by the cyclone has been pegged at more than Rs. 3,000 crore in Ganjam alone. Fishermen have suffered massive losses as their nets, boats and catamarans have been damaged, the Collector said. (Full coverage)
Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who visited relief camps in the cyclone-ravaged district today, was greeted by angry villagers who complained against lack of relief materials and demanded compensation. He has ordered payment of Rs. 500 each to those affected even as the administration will begin distribution of ration that will be supplied free of cost for the next two months. ""We will provide them money for rehabilitation and for crop damage... We are taking care of drinking water supply,"" he said.
Mr Patnaik also spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today and informed him about the post-cyclone situation and the state government's initiatives to bring back normalcy in the affected districts. He also requested the PM for technical support of Central power sector units for restoration of the power infrastructure in the state.
A part of National Highway 5, connecting Kolkata and Chennai, was blocked by several villagers today who were also agitating against the lack of relief material. Bhubaneswar: An unprecedented and timely evacuation drive, said to be the country's biggest ever, ensured minimum casualties as Cyclone Phailin slammed into coastal Odisha on Saturday evening. 23 people, including two in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, have died in the aftermath of the ""very severe"" storm, which has since weakened.

""The first priority was to save precious human lives and to a great extent we have achieved that,"" Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik told NDTV. (Watch) But now, with Phailin moving further inland, there is flood threat in Mayurbhanj and Baripada districts of Odisha and neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.

As Phailin passed through Odisha, nearly half of Baripada town was submerged due to a rise in water levels in the river, causing panic among the people. Several villages too were inundated as river Baitarani rose past the danger mark.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the cyclone is now closer to Chhattisgarh-Odisha border and very heavy rains are expected over north Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, east Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim in the next 48 hours. (Read)

Heavy rains and surging seawater, accompanying Phailin, the strongest storm to hit the country in more than a decade, flattened tens of thousands of thatched homes, destroyed more than five lakh hectares of crops and knocked out power lines in Odisha.

The worst affected area, around the coastal town of Gopalpur where the eye of Phailin came ashore packing winds of 200 kilometres an hour, was still without power as emergency services rushed to help people living there. Hundreds of workers from the country's National Disaster Response Force fanned out across the region, clearing away fallen trees from roads, mangled power poles and other debris.

Boerkircher told The Associated Press one person was killed when a structure collapsed in the tiny town of Jamestown. Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said another person was also found dead in northern Boulder.
""We're trying to get to Jamestown,"" Boerkircher said of a mountain community northwest of Boulder. ""A lot of towns need assistance, and we cannot get through.""Two other structures in the area were also damaged and may have collapsed.

At least one earthen dam gave way southeast of Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park, and water levels could rise downstream as authorities release more water to keep more dams from giving way.
A National Guard helicopter requested to help pull people from their homes hasn't been able to take off because of fog and low cloud cover throughout the area.
Flash flood warnings were issued for multiple counties in the region, including Jamestown and the Fourmile wildfire burn area.
Flash flood emergencies were also issued downstream from the Front Range mountain areas, including Fort Lupton, Dacono, Plateville and other farming areas as debris piled up near bridges.

The bodies of 78-year-old Bai Hengshu and his wife Wang Chengzhen were dug out of the thick mud debris in the floor of their house.Tears streaming, Liu Fang, their daughter-in-law, filled a pot with rainwater to wash away the silt debris covering their faces.The elderly couple was buried by debris in their house on Henan Street in Nankouqian Township after flood water suddenly inundated their house on Friday evening. Two younger sons and neighbors retrieved their bodies on Sunday afternoon.By 4 p.m. Monday, 85 people were confirmed dead and 105 were missing in the worst flood to hit northeast China in more than a decade.

Only three walls of villager Sun Xiaoxia's house remained standing, and the roof completely collapsed into the mud debris following the havoc.Sun said she left home and visited her relatives before the flood arrived. Seven of Sun's family members, including her husband and children, are unaccounted for. She feared her family members might have been buried in the debris.More than 30 soldiers were removing the debris and searching for her family.

Those alive should be strong and go on with their lives.

The Amur and Zeya rivers, near the Chinese border, burst their banks near the town of Blagoveshchensk after torrential rain.

""Thirty years of dry weather made people forgetful, and they started building in places where there is a risk of flooding,"" says Pyotr Osipov, an ecologist for the environmental group WWF in the Amur region.

He remembers the record flooding of 1984, when the Zeya spilled across a wider area than today. But since then more villages and towns have grown up along the banks. Somehow people believed there would be no more floods.

""We had the river pouring deep into the floodplains, as far as 15km (nine miles). It is no surprise, as the river bed formed over thousands of years without human involvement,"" Mr Osipov says.

He argues that the authorities should have moved people from risky areas long ago. Now they will have to do it anyway - but also spend money on compensation.

Lawyer Boris Burdeyev looks at floods
Lawyer Boris Burdeyev says people were let down by complacent local officials
Boris Burdeyev, a 30-year-old lawyer, is outraged. ""Why did they give permission to build here?"" he asks.

His house, in the village of Vladimirovka near Blagoveshchensk, used to be a long way from the river, but is now submerged up to its windows.

""This isn't some kind of shanty town - all the houses were built legally, with official approval,"" he says. He built his home four years ago at a cost of about 3m roubles (£58,000; $91,000). He does not know if it will be habitable after the water subsides.

Local authorities are paying about $300 each to those forced to flee affected areas. There is a promise of more compensation to come from the central government. It all depends on the value of their lost property and possessions, and could stretch to tens of thousands of dollars per person.

Threat of looting
But Yelena, who works for a local nursery, cannot say how much she will get in compensation, if anything.

""You have to prove what property you had, you have to present papers, photos.""

Although herself a flood victim, she helps other evacuees, who have been temporarily housed in a nursery school. Her own house, which she and her husband built in Vladimirovka, is now under water.

It was made of timber and was too close to the river, she says. A brick house would have survived, but theirs will be totally ruined.

There is more to worry about than the floodwaters. ""Looters are already working hard,"" says Yekaterina from the village of Grodekovo.

For the past 10 days she and her child have been staying at the nursery where Yelena works. Yekaterina's parents are still in the flooded village. ""They practically live up on the roof, surrounded by chickens, rabbits… and looters,"" she said.

But local residents say looting incidents have been rare. Grigory Nikishin, director of a holiday village in Belogorye, 20km upstream from Blagoveshchensk, said: ""We had a few attempts in the first days of flooding, but our security people and police chased them off.""

However, he decided to stay behind with several employees to keep watch over half-submerged buildings. ""All the ground-floor rooms are under water. The floors, tiling, linoleum is going to be ruined. All will have to be redone,"" he said.

Heavy rains lashing China's northeast and Russia's far east have not only unleashed massive floods but also looked to have stirred up bad blood, as the neighbours accuse each other of channelling unwanted water across the border.

The worst flooding seen in years has affected 3.7 million people and caused at least 72 deaths in China's northeast and prompted the evacuation of up to 100,000 in the Russian region.

Torrential rain in the past few weeks has burst the banks of the Amur River, which is called Heilongjiang in Chinese. The river runs through both countries and forms the border between the Chinese province of the same name and Russia's Amur, Khabarovsk and Jewish autonomous areas.

State broadcaster China Central TV (CCTV) said Russia's release of floodwater into the Amur has exacerbated the situation downstream in China. The water level of Heilongjiang near Jiayin county has risen by 30cm daily since August 7, CCTV reported last Saturday.

Some Chinese netizens have also hit out at Russia. ""Treating our Heilongjiang province as a reservoir for flood water. What a great ally!"" wrote a netizen nicknamed ""The Happy Life Of A Ghost"" on Sina microblog, referring to Russia.

Said Ma Airong, 50, a hostel owner from Heilongjiang's Mohe county bordering Russia: ""When they release water from their reservoir, we are affected.""

Four years ago, she told The Straits Times, she and other villagers were forced to flee to higher ground to escape the rising water.

Russian officials, in turn, have pointed the finger at China.

Vladimir Stepanov, head of Russia's National Crisis Management Centre, said in Moscow last week that most of the water causing the floods came from China, according to the Voice of Russia. If China keeps releasing water from its reservoirs into the Amur River, water levels could rise by 50 per cent, he added.

As of Sunday, 8pm Russian time, the Amur River near the city of Khabarovsk hit 6.49m, the highest since 1897. Radio Free Europe quoted Russia's chief health inspector Gennady Onishchenko, who warned on Sunday that flood waters from contaminated rivers in China are bringing harmful microbes and pollutants into the region.

However, Beijing played down talk of discord, with the Ministry of Water Resources saying on Sunday that both sides are working well together to fight the disaster. It noted that water inflow into Bureya Reservoir, in Russia's Far East, reached 5,050 cubic m per second last Friday, but Russia kept it at around 1,000 cubic m per second. 

""When flooding hit its Zeya and Bureya rivers, (Russia) made a strong effort to hold the flooding in its reservoirs, greatly reducing the flood pressure on the main stream of the Heilongjiang,"" it said in comments carried by China Daily.",1,Russia,4083,2,71,32,3554,1044,News

They warned that heavy rains would continue in coming days.Aung Kyaw, assistant director of the relief department at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, said 79 relief camps had been set up by Karen State authorities in 12 townships and sub-township for families displaced by the floods.“We evacuated 33,490 people and have settled them at camps that we set up,” he said, adding that Minister of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Nyan Tun was visiting the stricken area to coordinate relief operations.Days of torrential downpours caused the Salween River to burst its banks and flood large areas in both Karen and Mon states this weekend, and flooding continued to worsen in recent days.Aung Kyaw said the town of Myawaddy, on the Burma-Thailand border, was among the worst-affected areas, adding that the Thai border town of Mae Sot had also been badly flooded.Thein Zaw, Myawaddy Township administrator, said landslides had hit the road between Myawaddy and the Karen State capital Hpa-an at 10 places, adding that all road transport between the towns had been blocked for five days. The road winds through the Dawna Mountain Range.“Road engineers from Naypyidaw arrived today to start clearing the road, but I don’t know how long it will take,” he told The Irrawaddy on Thursday. “If we continue to lack transportation, commodity prices in both towns will go up.”In Mon State, Belin Township is badly affected and some 4,000 people have seen their homes inundated, according to local National League for Democracy member Kyaw Myo Min. He said a third of all villages in the district had been affected after water levels began to rise on Sunday night.
“We found one dead body while we were delivering food donations. About 2,000 people are now staying in camps. Totally, about 4,000 people were affected by flooding,” he said, adding that authorities were handing out small rice rations and dry clothing.“There are many people who are stuck in their homes and we handed them our food donations,” he said, adding that on Thursday water levels started to recede in Belin Township.Director of the Meteorology and Hydrology Department Chit Kyaw warned however, that heavy rains would resume in coming days in southern Burma and water levels could rise again.“Depending on the exact amount of the rain, the [southern] area could experience floods again,” he said. “We are warning people who stay near the river that they should not sleep at their houses or they should move away and sleep other people houses to avoid the danger of quickly rising water.”
A warning in government newspaper The New Light of Myanmar said water levels in the Salween River would continue to rise until Friday afternoon, when they could reach to about 1.42 meter above danger levels. It also warned that the Ngawun River in The Irrawaddy Delta could rise to 88 cm above danger levels.Overland and river transport between southern Burma and Thailand has been affected by the flooding, bringing cross-border trade to a halt. The Bangkok Post reported that border traders were losing approximately US $3.3 million per day due to the flooding.Roads between Rangoon, the Mon State capital Moulmein and Dawei port in Tennaserim Division have been blocked in recent days as routes were flooded and a bridge collapsed.Tala Mon Bus Company said transport between the cities had stopped for two days before resuming on Thursday afternoon.One truck driver said he and many colleagues had been stranded at a flooded road some 80 kilometers from Dawei. “No one could travel on the roads. We had to sleep for two nights in our trucks after a bridge collapsed,” he said. Nearly 25,000 people have been evacuated to makeshift camps after floods ravaged eastern Myanmar, an official said Wednesday, as relief teams struggled to reach remote areas inundated by water.Flood waters have risen dramatically after several days of heavy rain in Karen State forcing thousands to flee to nearly 80 relief camps, Chum Hre, director of the social welfare, relief and resettlement department told AFP.“Altogether 24,499 flood victims have been evacuated” in Karen State, he said, adding hundreds more had been displaced in Mon and Rakhine states.“It is very difficult to reach some of the disaster–hit places because of the bad weather and landslides,” he said, adding that helicopters had been deployed.Heavy rains also inundated areas across the border in Thailand.Seven Thai provinces remained flooded on Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said in its daily update.Three people have died since Monday after they were hit by trees felled by fast–moving water, it added.In Thailand’s western town of Mae Sot, which borders the flood–hit area of Myanmar, waters have receded in the town centre but remain high in outlying areas, especially near the frontier checkpoint.“The situation has returned to normal in Mae Sot city,” Pramote Chantasri, of Mae Sot City Municipality told AFP.“The worst was on Monday after four days of heavy rain in the mountains,” he said, adding the bridge between the two countries remains open.Parts of Thailand and Myanmar are inundated each year during the monsoon period, which ends in October.Deadly floods in 2011 left more than 800 dead in Thailand, inundating swathes of the country for months, deluging parts of the capital and taking a heavy toll on the country’s lucrative manufacturing industry.",1,Thailand,4081,1.5,69,30,3552,1042,News

Comments:  Heavy rains have resulted in a significant increase in the Parana river flow in Brazil, increasing pressure on the reservoir of the Itaipu dam, which releases water flow onto Paraguayan territory. This situation affects people located in the low areas of Paran? or close to the river beds in the Departments of Alto Paran?, Misiones, Itap?a and ?eembuc?. The situation is further aggravated due to the convergence of the Parana and Paraguay rivers which is flooding surrounding communities such as Paso de Patria, Mayor Martinez, Cerrito, Villalb?n and General D?az. Meteorological reports predict continued rains in the basin of the Igua?u and Parana rivers for the next few days, specifically in the departments of Canindey?, Alto Paran?, while Brazil's Parana state could receive more moderate rainfall. In response to the floods, the executive board of the Paraguayan Government has issued the Decree No. 11.313 by which ?Emergency is declared in Misiones, High Paran? and ?eembuc? departments affected by flooding and water overloads of water runways and emergency measures are taken"" for 90 days from 27 June 2013.

Last week the Paraná river in Paraguay broke its banks and the floods forced 800 people from their homes. The Paraná runs along the border between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil. Heavy rainfall, at around 10cm per day, has been falling for around 10 days in the region.

There are now reports that the heavy rains that swelled the levels of the Paraná have also brought water levels in the Iguazú river to high levels. The flow of the Paraná is said to be 3 times the norm, and the Iguazú is as much as 11 times higher than the normal flow at this time of year.

Flooding has now affected various parts of Argentina, including the provinces of Corrientes, Chaco and Santa Fe. Reports claim that around 10,000 people have been evacuated from the area while the river levels pose such a threat. Evacuation teams made up of police, fire department staff and volunteers have been helping with the evacuations. Those displaced have been taken to relief camps on higher ground.

The floods haven also hit the world famous Iguazú Park in Argentina, home of the Iguazú Falls, forcing the authorities to close parts of the national park to visitors on 27th June and dangerous areas – most of the walkways around the “Garganta del Diablo” track – will remain closed until it is deemed safe enough for tourists to return. Walkways over the river have been covered in debris and flood water. All sightseeing boat tours have also been suspended. The floods and high river levels are expected to last around 7 days.",1,0,4075,1.5,63,26,3546,1038,News

Exceptionally heavy seasonal rain in mid-July resulted in flooding in many parts of North Korea, with some areas recording twice the average monthly rainfall in just three days.

The International Federation of the Red Cross Crescent Societies (IFRC), which is carrying out relief work in the affected areas, says up to 50,000 people have been displaced by the floodwaters, which have destroyed more than 13,000 hectares of farmland.
Early crops, including potatoes, have perished and the July flooding is expected to have ""a longer term impact on food security"", the IFRC said in a recent report that noted the ""severe disruption"" of public access to safe water.
Decades of deforestation and decrepit infrastructure have left North Korea particularly vulnerable to floods, which led to some 170 deaths last summer

""But it's snapping back real quick. We are quite a resourceful lot.""City authorities have said it is still too early to estimate the costs of the floods in southern Alberta that left three people dead, devastated entire communities and forced at least 100,000 people from their homes in Calgary and elsewhere.But they will far exceed C$400 million ($381 million) in damage caused by a flood in 2005, known at the time as the ""flood of the century"".Although 60 percent of the downtown area now has power, Gianna Manes, chief executive of utility Enmax, said full restoration would take a number of days, given that tTwo lanes of the Trans-Canada Highway have opened west of Calgary after flooding destroyed part of the roadway near Canmore last week.""While this is the first step, we are in it for the long haul,"" said Alberta Transportation Minister Ric McIver.He said there remains a number of challenges in rebuilding highways, homes and communities throughout southern Alberta.Officials are warning drivers that the highway is still not in top condition and the speed limit has been lowered to 60 km/h.Elderly woman drowned in her homeA Calgary woman who was found dead her home in an evacuation zone died of drowning, an autopsy has confirmed.The 83-year-old woman was found by friends in her Erlton home Sunday. They had returned to check on her at her ground level residence.She had been contacted by police in person last Thursday about the mandatory evacuation, and all indications are that the woman was going to comply with the order.“Certainly this is tragedy for the family, for the friends, for the neighbours of the woman who passed away,” said Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi at a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.It was also announced Wednesday that the state of emergency in Calgary would be extended for eight more days, bringing the total of 21.“What that means is that we continue to have the ability to respond quickly, and flexibly,” said Nenshi.A state of emergency means that a municipality can circumvent bylaws, implement lane reversals on roads and spend money without pre-approval by council.The provincial act also gives the city power to conscript resources as needed.When explaining what that means, Nenshi used the example of a fence that needs reinforcing.“We can go to the Home Depot and steal their fence, and use it without asking,” said Nenshi.Power updates
Enmax CEO Gianna Manes said Wednesday afternoon that Mission, Cliff Bungalow, Beltline and Victoria Park are all expected to have power restored by 10 p.m. MT.""Certain buildings in this area may still have water in the basement and those individual buildings will not be able to have power to them until the building is dry,"" said Manes.In the downtown core, five out of seven power zones had been re-energized, though only 30 per cent of buildings are ready to have power restored.Across the city, there are still at least 11,000 people out of their homes, down from 100,000 at the peak of the crisis.Water tables a stumbling block
“We’re starting to see the water tables start to drop, which stops the continued infiltration, where as soon as you pump something up it fills back up,” said Bruce Burrell, Calgary Emergency Management Agency director.But Burrell warned that progress is likely to slow down. He compared progress to sponges, where work done up to now was like squeezing out a damp sponge and work being done now is like dealing with a sopping wet sponge.McLeod Trail, a major Calgary road leading into downtown, was reopened at 6:30 a.m. MT, but Memorial Drive and all bridges over Elbow River remain closed, said Burrell.Eighty per cent of roads have been reopened across the city, said Burrell on Wednesday morning.The Bow is still flowing at three times its normal rate, double the rate in 2005, said Nenshi.Towing in flood-affected areas
The city will start towing vehicles that are blocking access for flood-support equipment in affected areas.City officials are now asking people to go to nine Community Support Centres that have been set up, rather than tape paper requests to their homes. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)Previously, people had been told to put a sign in their window or make a 311 request if they needed to have power restored or water pumped out of their home.Now the city is asking people to stop putting signs in their windows, and instead to access one of nine Community Support Centres that were set up Wednesday morning. Requests through the 311 phone line or app will still be processed, but Burrell suggested that the centres would be more responsive because they are in the communities where requests originate.The centres will have representatives from Calgary police, fire, water resources, waste and recycling, development and building approvals and ATCO for utility and energy needs.They have been set up in communities most ravaged by the floods and will be open from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. MT, said Burrell.Sewage in the Bow RiverThe flooding has forced the city to dump raw sewage into the Bow River.The Bonnybrook Wastewater Treatment Plant was inundated with floodwater, say city officials.Mayor Naheed Nenshi said the city's other two plants are still operating, but municipalities downstream have been warned about the problems at Bonnybrook.“There is some sewage discharge into the river, which is not uncommon in conditions like this, and the important thing is the folks downstream know how to deal with it, just as we're dealing with it when it comes to us from upstream.”The city says the Bonnybrook plant is not meeting provincial standards right now, and it's working with Alberta Environment on the problem.Nenshi said the city’s two other plants are operating safely and communities downstream have been warned about the problem.",1,0,4068,2,56,23,3539,1035,News

The high-altitude road that is several kilometers long and considered the lifeline for reaching the border areas in this difficult terrain has been damaged at various points. At many places, it has just been washed away, at others, big boulders have broken down the road completely.The ghosts of 1962 war are still dancing in these parts of the border. The treacherous terrain, and the recent landslides, have yet again exposed the extreme folly of not developing the region because of a lopsided fear of Chinese military waves sweeping in through good roads. It was the defeat by the Chinese military that prompted the government not to develop road networks along the China border, but today that decision is haunting the lives of thousands and strategic military posts.
According to local sources, the only way to approach the border posts now is through helicopters, which is also not very easy considering that it is a difficult, high-terrain area. Alternate routes on the treacherous terrain is also very difficult, and not sufficient to carry a large number of Army men or supplies.
When asked for its comments, Army headquarters in New Delhi said the Dharali-Nelong stretch, north of Harsil, has witnessed landslides which are normal there. It said all the roads in the area have been washed away, but ""foot movement and connectivity are there"".Officers who were on their way to the post have been stranded and are currently helping in relief and rescue operations at Harsil, one of the last cantonment areas in the region. Sources said while adequate supplies and ration was there at the post, a delay in constructing the road could lead to constraints going forward.The bad weather in the area and the difficult terrain is expected to make this task difficult, and with the monsoon rains around, not much headway is expected here. With winter setting in thereafter, it gets more difficult as the whole area gets engulfed in heavy snow.Sources said a team specially brought in to construct bunkers in the border post had also been stranded. These have Army men from the Engineers Corps.The story of Nelong's single road and its destruction represents the strategic fallouts of deadly rains and landslides of last week. The single most important road on the Badrinath stretch, Rishikesh-Joshimath-Badrinath-Mana road is also broken at various locations. The story isn't very different in other stretches in Uttarakhand. And on the rest of the border with China, it would only take a heavy downpour to expose the poor Indian infrastructure, compared to the sleek connectivity up to the last post on the China side"". Thousands stranded in parts of northern India awaited rescuers on Wednesday as floods caused by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains killed at least 150 people in worst-hit Uttarakhand.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a 10-billion-rupee aid package for the state after he and Congress president Sonia Gandhi did an aerial survey of the flood-hit region.“The government will not spare any effort in rescue and relief operations,” Singh said on his official Twitter account, adding the large-scale devastation they witnessed was “most distressing”.“The priority for the authorities at the moment is to rescue the stranded and provide urgently needed succour to those most in need of it,” he said.This year, the rains are at least twice as heavy in northwest and central India as the annual monsoon rains covered the whole country faster than usual....

The monsoon generally hits north India by June end. But the movement of clouds was such that the entire country was covered with monsoon by June 16, a good month ahead of its schedule date for the first time since 1961.

The operation became necessary due to continued flooding of several villages behind the break. It appears to have been successful.The fight against the record floods that have struck Germany over the last two weeks is largely over, with rivers having returned to their banks and clean-up well underway. But in one part of the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, the battle continued over the weekend -- and it was one in which authorities were forced to come up with an unorthodox method to plug a breach in an Elbe River dike just east of Berlin.On Saturday, two barges were sunk using explosives at a gap in a levee in an attempt to stop floodwaters from continuing to flow into the countryside. On Sunday, an additional barge was sunk at the site to block up the final 20 meters (66 feet) of the 90 meter breach. Helicopters carrying oversized sandbags and pieces of concrete then filled in around the sunken boats. Officials on Sunday evening said that the gap had been 80 percent sealed as a result of the operation.
The spectacular fix became necessary after the dike gave way last week, flooding several small towns behind the dike and resulting in thousands of people being evacuated. Now that the water has ceased flowing from the swollen Elbe through the gap in the levee, the flooded area behind it has begun to slowly shrink. Still, some 145 square kilometers of land (56 square miles) remain under water.
It was the first time ever in Germany that sunken ships were used to plug a hole in a dike. The barges were carefully maneuvered into place before explosives on board were detonated so as to ground the craft. Then, several helicopters began flying gigantic sacks of sand to the site to prevent the barges from drifting away.""It was an extremely difficult and risky operation,"" Saxony-Anhalt Governor Reiner Haselhoff told German news agency DPA. ""But we had to do something and to try everything in our power to stop the water.""
Captain Thomas Peter, who maneuvered the barges into position, said: ""We'd never done such a thing before. But we're not crazy. We were able to half-way assess the situation.""Elsewhere on the Elbe River on Monday, officials reported that water levels were well down from their peaks and were continuing to drop.""

PRAGUE, June 3 (Reuters) - Volunteers piled up sandbags to keep a swollen river from overwhelming the Czech capital's historic centre on Monday after floods across central Europe forced factories to closed, drove thousands from their homes and killed at least eight people.Six people died in the Czech Republic from the worst flooding in a decade and a state of emergency was declared, while in Austria two people died and another two were missing.The flooding, which also affected parts of Germany, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, sent shares in reinsurers Munich Re and Hannover Re down by about 2.5 percent, with markets anticipating big claims from property owners once the waters recede.The flooding arose from several days of torrential rainfall. In some places two months worth of rain fell in just a few days.Carmaker Volkswagen temporarily shut its plant in Zwickau, in the eastern German state of Saxony, because the flooding stopped workers reaching the factory.In the centre of the west German town of Passau, people took off their shoes and rolled up their trousers to walk through the ankle-deep water.The last time central Europe saw similar floods was in 2002, when 17 people were killed in the Czech Republic, and damage estimated at 20 billion euros ($26 billion) was inflicted.Officials in Prague, the Czech capital listed by the U.N. cultural agency as a World Heritage Site, said they did not anticipate the waters of the Vltava river would reach 2002 levels.But they were taking no chances. They shut the metro system and, in streets near the river, soldiers put up metal fences - the sort of flood defences ordered after the disaster 11 years ago. Elsewhere, volunteers built walls of sandbags.Tigers at Prague zoo were tranquilised and moved out of an enclosure at risk from flooding.Czech officials said the flood defences in Prague should hold, but that the river level was likely to rise again on Tuesday morning. ""The story is not yet over here,"" said Czech Environment Minister Tomas Chalupa.CAFES SUBMERGED The Charles Bridge, a favourite spot for tourists that dates to the 14th century, was closed. Tree trunks floated by in the muddy brown water. A riverside path that is below street level, is usually populated with cyclists and people sitting at cafes, was under water on Monday.
""We left England yesterday and it was sunny and warm. We didn't expect this, we don't even have our raincoats,"" said British tourist Alison Tadman, who came to Prague with her husband, Adrian, to celebrate her 47th birthday.She and her husband were sheltering in a McDonald's restaurant. ""We're pretty disappointed,"" she said.

Some of the worst flooding was around the Danube river, which starts in Germany and winds its way through countries including Austria, Slovakia and Hungary on its way to the Black Sea. The river was swollen by heavy rain at the weekend.In Germany, the interior minister flew to flood-hit regions on Monday and Chancellor Angela Merkel was preparing to go on Tuesday, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.How her government responds to the emergency could have some bearing on the outcome of a nationwide election in September.Shipping was stopped on parts of the Danube and Rhine rivers in Germany, and along the entire Austrian stretch of the Danube, because of the high waters. The rivers are important arteries for moving grains, coals and other commodities.

Thousands of people living in low-lying areas in Austria and the Czech Republic had to be evacuated from their homes. In the Austrian town of Schaerding, a duck swam across a road intersection, past the gates of a flooded cemetery.The flooding killed five people in the Czech Republic over the weekend and on Monday the death toll went up to six - a worker electrocuted while trying to switch off a flooded electricity transformer 50 km (30 miles) east of Prague, the Czech news agency CTK reported.In the Austrian city of Salzburg, 160 passengers were put up overnight in army barracks after the floods stranded their train. Austrian Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger told reporters the situation in some areas was ""very fraught.""The risk on Monday was that the flood danger could follow the course of the Danube river downstream to other European countries along its route.Workers erected flood barriers along the banks of the Danube where it passes through the Slovak capital, Bratislava, and police shut several roads.""We are getting bad news from Germany and Austria. We have to do all we can to protect ... the capital,"" Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said.In Hungary, whose capital Budapest also sits on the banks of the Danube, state media quoted Gyorgy Bakondi, head of the National Disaster Authority, as saying that 400 people were working on flood defences.He said water levels in the river could reach or even exceed the height seen in the record flooding in 2002.Some climate scientists cited a possible link between extreme weather such as flooding and climate change. The warmer the air, the more moisture it holds. A study last year by a United Nations panel of scientists said heavy rainfalls will become more common in this century. BERLIN — Raging waters from three rivers have flooded large parts of the southeast German city of Passau following days of heavy rainfall in central Europe.A spokesman for the city's crisis center said Monday that the situation was ""extremely dramatic"" and waters are expected to rise further by midday to their level highest in 70 years.
Herbert Zillinger told The Associated Press that much of the city was inaccessible except by boat and electricity supplies have been shut off as a precaution.At least four people have reportedly died and nine are missing due to floods in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic in recent days.",1,Czech Republic,4063,2,51,19,3534,1031,News

In Eidsvoll, northeast of Oslo, around 40 homeowners were told to leave their homes because of fears a dam further upslope would burst. Others were evacuated in the counties of Hedmark, Oppland, Buskerud and Telemark as officials categorized this year’s spring flooding as the worst since 1995, so far.It may get even worse, with more rain predicted and more rapid melting of snow and ice at higher elevations. Instead of beginning to melt slowly at the end of winter, this year’s unusually cold spring kept the snow and ice frozen well into May. When temperatures suddenly soared last week, the annual run-off quickly turned into the gushing torrents now threatening so many areas that emergency crews were struggling to keep up with demand.

The pumping of flooded cellars quickly became a lower priority on Wednesday as crews worked to prevent more damage by trying to divert the deluge. Roads and major highways were blocked and closed all over southern Norway, with the heavily trafficked E6 highway through Gudbrandsdalen closed in several places. The list of closed roads was so long that radio announcers on Norwegian Broadcasting (NRK) referred listeners to the state highway department’s website for the full list that was constantly being updated (external link, in Norwegian: “Stengt” means closed).

State railway NSB and railroad Jernbaneverket were also facing enormous challenges, with tracks washed out in numerous places or covered by mud- and rockslides. Main train routes through Gudbrandsdalen and Osterdalen that connect Oslo and Trondheim had to be shut down and NSB couldn’t provide alternative bus transport because adjacent roads were blocked as well. The Kongsvinger line to Oslo re-opened, however, providing some good news for commuters Thursday morning, but passengers were warned of delays throughout the day. Several long-distance truck drivers had to spend the night in or around Hamar because of highway closures that trapped them where they were, not least because their vehicles are too large to drive on the narrower secondary roads that were being used for detours. In addition to the evacuations in Eidsvoll and Kvam, around 20 homeowners were ordered to leave their homes in Nesbyen and 43 in Nord-Aurdal.

There were reports they may never be allowed to return and will be forced to rebuild in other areas because of the increased incidence of flooding in recent years. Insurance companies were launching a debate over whether other policy holders should be expected to effectively pay for the losses suffered by those who insisted on rebuilding in areas hit by floods just two years ago. Politicians are expected to tackle the issue when the immediate crisis was over."" ""Flooding forces people from homes in Norway

In Burma, there were fears for tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims living in camps in low-lying areas of Rakhine state.They were displaced by ethnic violence last year and many were reluctant to move from the camps.One refugee, Hla Maung, said he had lost his mother and two young daughters during the clashes between Muslims and Buddhists last year, and would not move from the camp.""I lost everything. I don't want to go anywhere. I'll stay here.

A 1991 cyclone that slammed into Bangladesh from the Bay of Bengal killed an estimated 139,000 people and left millions homeless. In 2008, Myanmar’s southern delta was devastated by Cyclone Nargis, which swept away entire farming villages and killed more than 130,000 people. Both those cyclones were much more powerful than Mahasen, which hit land with maximum wind speeds of about 100 kph (62 mph) and quickly weakened, said Alam, the meteorological official.By the time it hit Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar, wind speeds had plunged to 25 kph (16 mph), Alam said. The storm then dissipated entirely, he said.Bangladesh’s government said at least 10 people were killed by the storm across the nation’s vast coastal region, most either from the collapse of mud walls or hit by fallen trees.Related heavy rains and flooding in Sri Lanka were blamed for eight deaths earlier this week.At least eight people — and possibly many more — were killed in Myanmar as they fled the cyclone Monday night, when overcrowded boats carrying more than 100 Rohingya capsized.

Inside, his pepper plants - in which he has invested about 1,000 euros ($1,300) - lay under waters as placid as a lake's.Submerged orange and lemon groves stand around, while dry pockets that rise above the water here and there are covered in parked cars.A month after heavy rains started, more than 700 houses in the Shkoder district remain surrounded by three feet (about a meter) of floodwater, although their residents stayed on as most buildings are dry inside. About 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land are waterlogged, and rafts or small boats are the only mode of transportation.Obot lies five kilometers (3 miles) from the national road. To cover that distance now takes half an hour by small boat.

The area has experienced severe floods three times in the past four years, and serves as a basin for surrounding regions.
Pellumb Dani, an official at the Shkoder prefecture, said Thursday that the area is prone to flooding whenever there is heavy rain, particularly as the country's three main hydropower stations that cover 95 percent of domestic electricity needs are built on the nearby Drini River.When it rains a lot, operators are forced to discharge water to lessen the load on dams that could otherwise crack. That goes downstream and floods the surrounding countryside. Dani said the volume of water entering the area in recent days was at times nearly twice as much as can be naturally absorbed or carried away by rivers.But farmers in Obot alleged that power authorities tried to stock up a lot of water in the dams during the summer, and the sheer volume of winter rain took them by surprise, quickly bringing reservoir water to near-dangerous levels.""There has never been flooding in spring,"" 83-year old Pjeter Gjocaj said from a verandah on his water-surrounded house.

The villagers have temporarily taken up shelter in houses and school buildings in nearby villages that escaped the flooding. “Musi Banyuasin is the worst hit area. We have declared an emergency flooding situation in the area,” said South Sumatra Social Agency head Apriyadi in Palembang on Wednesday. 

Apriyadi said that the administration had yet to calculate the total financial loss caused by the disaster. 

The social agency, he continued, had distributed 55 tons of rice, 800 boxes of instant noodles, canned fish and clothes. 

“We have also established a number of posts at the border of Musi Banyuasin and Musi Rawas,” Apriyadi added. 

Apriyadi said that this flooding was the worst since the 2007 disaster. The flooding, he said, was caused by non-stop heavy rains and widespread deforestation in the area. 

As of Wednesday, road access to Musi Rawas was still cut off by flooding, said South Sumatra Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) Yulizar Dinoto. 

Despite the magnitude of flooding, no casualties were reported according to South Sumatra Health Agency head Mat Dani. He said that he had also sent medical teams to take care of flood victims. 

In Legok subdistrict, Telenaipura district, Jambi, the 240 families affected by a flash flood in December requested additional shelter as the four tents that had been provided were simply insufficient. 

Jambi Legislative Council speaker Effendi Hatta, who visited the flood victims on Tuesday, said that he would ask the administration to provide more tents. 

Meanwhile, the remains of two residents of Gitgit village in Bali’s Buleleng regency were found under the debris of a landslide that closed the main road connecting Singaraja and Denpasar on Tuesday night.

Members of the search and rescue team discovered the bodies of Gede Mertada, 35, and Gede Mulyawan Atmaja, 27, underneath mud and other materials on Wednesday morning.

It was reported that the two men, together with other residents of the village, had been working to clear the road of debris from an earlier landslide when another landslide occurred.

I Putu Dana, the head of the Buleleng BPBD, said that the landslides affected a 5-metre stretch of road and had carried heaps of mud, rocks, fallen trees and trash into almost all parts of Gitgit village, which is located on the main Singaraja-Denpasar road.

Gitgit and the neighboring villages near Bedugul resort, an area bordering Tabanan and Buleleng regencies, are very vulnerable to natural disasters because of their geographical and geological positioning. 

The villages are in the hilly areas of Mount Batukaru, surrounded by three major lakes - Beratan, Tamblingan and Buyan - as well as a vast forested area. 

“Almost every year, landslides, flooding, strong winds and other natural disasters occur here, claiming lives, affecting farms and livestock,” explained Dana.

Buleleng is one of the most disaster-prone regencies in Bali, along with Bangli and Karangasem.

Illegal logging, land conversion for farming and the natural topography have contributed to frequent landslides in these areas.
Authorities in the Krasnodar region, which will host the 2014 Winter Games in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, have been under pressure since July floods killed over 170 people in the region, including more than 150 in the town of Krymsk. Locals have complained that that there was no proper early warning system in place to alert the population.
Three Krymsk officials have been detained and suspected of failing to properly warn the residents about the coming floods. But Krasnodar Region Governor Alexander Tkachyov, who faced a barrage of criticism for mishandling the floods, has managed to keep his post.

Vast areas of the state were inundated, forcing thousands of evacuations, destroying homes, isolating communities and devastating farms still struggling to recover from the 2011 floods.

Agricultural organisations warned many farms might not survive.

Six people died in the floods, and search and rescue teams were yesterday still checking for more possible victims in hard-hit areas of North Bundaberg, 400km north of Brisbane.

The floods also ripped away many of the repairs and rebuilding of roads, bridges and other infrastructure carried out since 2011 as well as causing new damage that already appears to be overtaking the cost of the earlier disaster.

State Premier Campbell Newman said the bill had already topped A$2.4 billion ($3 billion) and was still climbing, exceeding the A$2.38 billion impact of 2011.


Insurers estimate the cost of the almost 26,000 claims received so far at A$290 million.

Newman said a permanent fix was needed to protect communities from regular floods and other disasters.

""We can't accept that our communities can be flooded every couple of years,"" he said. ""We can't accept that's how life has to be lived.""

Newman warned the cost would be huge, requiring a wide range of measures including the rethinking of developments, relocating parts of some towns, new levees and more flood mitigation dams.

The full scale of the week's inundation is only now emerging as waters recede and roads reopen, allowing access to areas isolated by floodwaters.

Some areas remain at risk. At Rockhampton, 600km north of Brisbane, the Fitzroy River was expected to peak at 8.5m late last night, below the 2011 peak but likely to affect more than 1000 properties.

Water was rising in some suburbs late yesterday, but authorities were hopeful most homes would escape.

The Condamine River was also still rising, cutting off the Western Downs town of Condamine. The small communities of Toobeah and Bungunya, near Goondawindi on the NSW border, were also isolated.

In Bundaberg, the worst-hit area where about 2000 homes were flooded, some residents were yesterday allowed back to devastated areas of the city's north as waters receded.

Access remained difficult and limited, with roads severely damaged. On one road floodwaters had gouged a 100m-long trench, 2m deep.

Power, water and sewerage had been cut, with no indication of when they would be repaired.

A packed town meeting yesterday was told that 10 properties in the area had been destroyed and about 30 severely damaged.

Bundaberg Council chief executive Peter Byrne said damage was severe, with one home washed onto the road and another missing.

""What I'm saying to you the gravity of the situation is dire,"" he said.

Journalists from Brisbane's Courier Mail, allowed into the stricken suburbs under police escort, described scenes of devastation: homes wrecked, some ripped from their foundations, and cars and trucks trapped in a quagmire of mud.

One weatherboard house had been driven 400m down the street and wrapped around a power pole. All that remained of others were brick remnants. A church had also been destroyed.

Southwest of Bundaberg, the town of Gayndah remained without power.

At Gympie, 160km north of Brisbane, residents and business owners returned yesterday to survey damage after about 150 properties were flooded when the Mary River broke its banks.

Amancio Nhantumbo of the Mozambique National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) said the flood-related deaths occurred in the province of Nampula and were caused mainly by “drowning, acute diarrhoea and lightning”.Nearly 2 000 homes have been destroyed in the area, INGC said, with thousands of displaced families living in resettlement camps.Nampula authorities were carrying out compulsory evacuations of residents living in low-lying areas at risk of further flooding.In southern Mozambique, floods have killed 105 people and displaced 150 000 since the beginning of the rainy season in October.Meanwhile, Cahora Bassa hydroelectric CEO Antonio Muxanga told reporters that transmission lines carrying electricity to South Africa were under threat and could collapse at any time.The United Nations emergency humanitarian fund today announced it will distribute more than $5 million to provide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of people who have been affected by the recent floods in Mozambique.Heavy rains last month led to massive flooding in the southern part of the country, killing 105 people and displacing some 150,000. Hundreds of houses were destroyed and crops and infrastructure severely damaged.In a news release, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the Government and its partners have already allocated $10 million to cope with the emergency. However, given the scale of the disaster, more resources are required for those who lost everything in the floods.The funds, $5.13 million in total, will be distributed from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which is managed by OCHA, to various UN agencies to provide basic needs and services such as shelter, food, medical aid, water, sanitation and hygiene, and logistical protection to those in need.“While much has been done, much more is needed. These CERF funds will go a long way in ensuring that assistance is provided to those who need it most,” said the UN Resident Coordinator in Mozambique, Jennifer Topping.
The World Food Programme (WFP) will receive $2.3 million, and more than $1 million will be allocated to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), respectively. A further $820,000 will be given to a joint UNICEF/UN Population Fund (UNFPA)/World Health Organization (WHO) project"" January 31, 2013: Maputo, Mozambique - The United Nations says the death toll from the flooding in Mozambique has risen by seven to at least 55 people.The U.N. said Thursday that heavy rains in northern and central Mozambique have displaced 19 000 more people, raising the total number of displaced by floods the past two weeks to nearly 170 000.
The Mozambican government said there is a shortage of food for flood victims in southern Mozambique. Luis Nhala, a health official, said that residents are eating food that has mixed with contaminated flood water, which is resulting in cases of diarrhoea and vomiting.""January 15, 2013:""MAPUTO, Jan 22 – Mozambique authorities on Tuesday considered the evacuation of 50,000 people after heavy rainfall in the flood-struck south, where hundreds died in a major deluge over a decade ago, an UN aid agency said.
The waters have killed 35 people since the start of the rainy season last October — 13 in January alone — and eight major rivers are above alert levels.

“The alert level is five metres (16 feet). Yesterday it reached six (metres). If it will go one more metre then it will create a big problem,” said Hanoch Barlevi, local emergency specialist at the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
“If this scenario happens, the community that is going to be affected is around 50,000 people,” he told AFP.
The southern Africa nation is experiencing the heaviest rainfall since devastating floods in 2000 killed around 800 people and affected millions.
According to Barlevi, authorities have since developed sophisticated disaster management systems, so a repeat of the tragedy is unlikely.
From Sunday to Monday almost 185 millimetres (over seven inches) of rain poured over the Limpopo river basin in southern province Gaza, where the most vulnerable communities live.
Rains in neighbouring countries also swelled rivers, and authorities opened the sluices from two dams in the south to lower dangerous levels.
Coastal Mozambique is home to nine international river basins, making it especially vulnerable to flooding. Although the rainfall has stopped in most areas, the risk of flooding remains high as waters arrive from further inland.
“Unfortunately there are always consequences from the entire region and not only in Mozambique. The rain stops but the effects come a few days later,” Barlevi explained.
Mozambique’s disaster management teams are set to meet later Tuesday to decide on evacuations.   Beitbridge Bureau — ZIMBABWE and South African border authorities were yesterday forced to stop both vehicular and human traffic after the bridge at the Beitbridge Border Post was flooded on Sunday night.

The border was only open to travellers after 3am when the waters subsided.

The torrential rains also claimed the lives of three children aged between four and nine years when the houses they were sleeping in collapsed.

Authorities at the border post were forced to stop traffic after the flooded Limpopo River left the New Limpopo Bridge inaccessible.

The bridge links Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The bridge was temporarily closed for three hours at midnight on Sunday.

It was only reopened at around 3am when the water had subsided.

Border authorities from both countries had to harmonise traffic control systems to ensure the safety of motorists.

They also temporarily suspended movement of heavy vehicles over the bridge.

The Old Limpopo Bridge was safe for pedestrians though the situation was under close monitoring by the authorities.

The children's deaths bring to five the number of people who have died in Beitbridge District due to torrential rains that started last week.

Two people drowned, one along Bubi River and another one in a pond in the town.

Forty-two more people were stranded at Chituripasi Village 10, under Chief Elsh Matibe's area.

Their huts were destroyed by heavy rains that hit the area on Saturday and Sunday.

Authorities had also dispatched an Air Force of Zimbabwe helicopter to assist stranded villagers yesterday afternoon.

Beitbridge Civil Protection Unit chairman Mr Simon Muleya said the situation was terrible. Three children were killed in separate incidents when their homes collapsed during heavy rains in Limpopo over the weekend, authorities said.


Vhembe district municipality spokesperson Matodzi Mulaudzi said on Sunday the municipality's disaster management team received the reports about the deaths of two boys and a girl on Sunday morning. 

""A helicopter was sent to a house in Mutele D Village, where it was reported that a girl was killed after a house collapsed on her on Sunday morning,"" said Mulaudzi.

The helicopter was sent after the municipality's disaster management team was unable to gain access to the village in their vehicles because Mutele River was overflowing. Two other children were killed in two separate villages in Malamule.

Police spokesperson Colonel Ronel Otto confirmed the death of two boys who were killed when their homes collapsed in Malamulele on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Leonard Hlathi said three people were killed when lightning struck their houses in Piet Retief during heavy thunderstorms on Saturday morning.

Also in Mpumalanga, an eight-year-old boy was believed to have been swept away in Tonga by the streams and a 67-year-old woman killed after her mud-constructed house fell on her.

'Hardest hit'
""The Tonga area near Komatipoort has been hardest hit by the bad weather in the province with three vehicles having been reported as being swept away by the Nkomazi River,"" said Hlathi. 

These included a traffic department vehicle, with an unconfirmed number of occupants, an ambulance with two paramedics inside, and a private car with two occupants inside. Hlathi said the paramedics were rescued by members of the police water wing.

""Two occupants in the private vehicle were rescued by members of the South African National Defence Force,"" he said.

Other survivors were rescued after they managed to hold on to the trees on the side of the roads until help was found.

KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said some roads had to be closed on Saturday after heavy rains blocked several drainage systems in the northern parts of the province.

""A disaster management team was mobilised and sent to eMpangeni to clear several roads where the water drainage systems were blocked,"" said Mabaso. He said a disaster management team had since been activated and was monitoring the situation.

Assessing the damages
On Friday, 31 houses were flooded at Kanana in the North West, officials said on Sunday. Provincial spokesperson Lesiba Kgwele said a disaster management team was assessing the damages.

The flooding has so far resulted in three deaths and significant damage to property and crops. Mafuleka told IRIN that her department is carrying out an assessment to determine more accurately the extent of flood-related damage and the needs of those affected. Displacement and damage
The hardest-hit areas are Phalombe, Mangochi, and Nsanje districts, all in the south of the country and in the same region that, only months ago, had been suffering from too little rain. The resulting poor harvests had left nearly 2 million people without enough food to get them through the lean season, according to an October 2012 assessment by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee (MVAC).
Now, as heavy rains continue, farmers and officials fear the floodwaters will damage crops and worsen hunger.
In Phalombe, thousands of people have been displaced by flooding, and many have evacuated to makeshift shelters in schools and churches. One school alone is sheltering 1,400 people, according to Davi Chibani, assistant district risk management officer, who is on the ground coordinating rescue and relief efforts. Other temporary camps are sheltering hundreds each. 
Chibani says that if the rains do not subside soon, severe crop damage and another year of poor harvests is likely.

The president was pictured standing in water up to his shins — his trousers rolled up — at the palace waiting for the arrival of Argentina's leader on a state visit.
The floods were the most widespread to hit Jakarta in recent memory. Authorities said at least four people were killed and 20,000 evacuated. Many more homes were inundated following around five hours of heavy overnight rain that coursed through rivers already swollen by a long monsoon season.
Few areas in the city were spared, from wealthy suburbs to riverside slums and gleaming downtown business blocks. Offices and schools were deserted and traffic ground to a halt. The international airport was operating normally, but travelers were finding it hard to get there.
“This is horrible,” said Yanitha Damayanti, a bank teller stranded downtown. “For the first time in my life, downtown Jakarta has flooded.”
The city has long been prone to floods, but successive governments have done little to mitigate the threat.
Deforestation in the hills to the south of the city, chaotic planning and the rubbish that clogs the hundreds of rivers and waterways that crisscross the city are some of the factors behind the floods. The city's vulnerability exposes the country's poor infrastructure even as it has posted impressive economic growth in recent years.

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the country's foreign minister were pictured standing in water up to their shins at the presidential palace waiting for the arrival of Argentina's President Christina Kirchner, who is on a state visit. The meeting of the two leaders apparently went ahead.

“I have no problem with the palace being flooded, “Yudhoyono said. “The most important thing is the people are protected.”

In some places, water levels were up to 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) high. Seen from above, the main road through the heart of the city resembled a muddy river. Even as authorities struggled to rescue those trapped and provide them food and shelter, some were thinking of the economic cost.

According to data from the Meteorology Department and Disaster Management Centre (DMC), more than 5,370 houses were destroyed while 33,571 were dpartially amaged. So far, the death toll stands at 52 dead and eight missing.

To date the government has set up 71 camps for 7,409 people (1,970 families in total). To help the displaced, the Church, local NGOs and aid associations are distributing dry rations and cooked meals.

The worst affected area is that of the Eastern Province, with 404,930 persons (109,632 families in total) because it is most exposed to torrential rains. 10 refugee camps have been set up there. In the Northern Province, more than 83,080 persons belonging to 23,122 families have been affected by the monsoon. Many of them have found refuge in 12 evacuation centers set up by the government.

“There are businessmen and people who are making trips and domestic tourists who are visiting the archaeological sanctuary of Machu Picchu through this zone and who, upon becoming stranded, have had to walk for several hours,” the governor said.

Last year, the ancient Inca citadel of Machu Picchu was affected by the overflowing of the Vilcanota River and had to closed to the public for two months so that the train line leading to it, which had been damaged by flooding, could be repaired.

Officials, however, so far have not said that they are going to have to take measures of this kind at Machu Picchu, which this year will celebrate the 100th year of its discovery.

Fifty towns in Ancash located on the so-called Huaylas and Conchucos routes have been rendered incommunicado by several mudslides that buried the roads this past week, emergency management officials told the El Comercio newspaper.

In Ancash, one of the country’s main tourist attractions, the snow-covered Pastoruri mountain has reduced its schedule for visits by mountaineers to just the morning hours because of the presence later in the day of electrical storms and heavy rain.

Meanwhile, in the region of Huanuco, the overflowing of the Pachitea River has left 550 people affected in the Yuyapichis district, in the province of Puerto Inca, because of the flooding of 110 homes, as well as an unknown number of crop fields.

In the region of Pasco, at least 65 communities in the districts of Puerto Bermudez and Ciudad Constitucion remain under water after the overflowing of the Pichis River, emergency management officials said.

The intense rains have prevented the operation of helicopters in the area to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid, forcing the emergency management office to send some 25 tons of food, clothing, and construction materials by land.

There are 5,000 people affected in Pasco between those who lost their homes and all their possessions and others who suffered more minor damage, but all of them need food and medical attention to prevent the spread of disease, officials said.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) - At least 43 villagers and soldiers drowned in a southern Philippine town Tuesday when torrents of water dumped by a powerful typhoon cascaded down a mountain, engulfing emergency shelters and an army truck, officials said. The deaths raised the toll from one of the strongest storms to hit the country this year to at least 74.Gov. Arturo Uy said rain from Typhoon Bopha accumulated atop a mountain and then burst down on Andap village in New Bataan town in hard-hit Compostela Valley province. The victims included villagers who had fled from their homes to a school and village hall, which were then swamped by the flash flood. An army truck carrying soldiers and villagers was washed away, according to Uy and army officials.""They thought that they were already secure in a safe area, but they didn't know the torrents of water would go their way,"" Uy told DZBB radio.He said the confirmed death toll in the town was likely to rise because several other bodies could not immediately be retrieved from floodwaters strewn with huge logs and debris.Bopha slammed into Davao Oriental province region at dawn, its ferocious winds ripping roofs from homes and its 500-kilometer (310-mile) -wide rain band flooding low-lying farmland.The storm, packing winds of 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 170 kph (106 mph), toppled trees, triggered landslides and sent flash floods surging across the region's mountains and valleys.Two entire provinces lost power and more than 100 domestic flights were canceled. About 60,000 people fled to emergency shelters.Twenty-three people drowned or were pinned by fallen trees or collapsed houses in Davao Oriental province's coastal town of Cateel, which had the most deaths after New Bataan, Davao Oriental Gov. Corazon Malanyaon told the ABS-CBN TV network, citing police reports.Some towns in the province were so battered that no roofs remained on buildings, Malanyaon said.The other deaths included three children who were buried by a wall of mud and boulders that plunged down a mountain in Marapat village, also in Compostela Valley. Their bodies were wrapped in blankets by their grieving relatives and placed on a stage in a basketball court.""The only thing we could do was to save ourselves. It was too late for us to rescue them,"" said Valentin Pabilana, who survived the landslide.In Davao Oriental, a poor agricultural and gold-mining province about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of Manila, an elderly woman was killed when her house was struck by a falling tree, said Benito Ramos, who heads the government's disaster-response agency.The other victims either drowned or were hit by trees, he said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise.While some 20 typhoons and storms normally lash the archipelago nation annually, the southern provinces battered by Bopha are unaccustomed to fierce typhoons, which normally hit the northern and central Philippines.A rare storm last December killed more than 1,200 people and left many more homeless and traumatized, including in Cagayan de Oro city, where church bells pealed relentlessly on Tuesday to warn residents to scramble to safety as a major river started to swell.Officials were taking no chances this year, and President Benigno Aquino III appealed on national TV on Monday for people in Bopha's path to move to safety and take storm warnings seriously.",1,0,4005,2,115,39,3477,1010,News

Their deaths brought the toll to four in flooding that has damaged many homes and stores as well as thousands of acres of farmland.One of the hardest hit areas was the Maremma zone of southern Tuscany, where flooding washed out many secondary roads, forced hundreds of people to leave their homes, and isolated several towns.The main A-1 highway was closed in parts of Tuscany, where it runs close to rivers.
At least four people were killed when torrential rains caused rivers to burst their banks in Italy’s province of Tuscany, news reports said on Wednesday.Two days of heavy rains also rode roughshod over the provinces of Lazio, Liguria and Umbria, causing power cuts and transport disruptions there.In another development, floods in Venice have left 70 percent of the historic port city under water.At least 3 die in floods in ItalyAccording to preliminary information, 3 people have died in central Italy as a result of flooding caused by heavy rains.According to local authorities, two men and one woman were killed when their car fell off a collapsed bridge into a river.In the regions of Umbria and Tuscany rivers burst their banks due to several days of unending rains.
Italy hit by rainsPouring rains that occurred in Italy last weekend caused landslides in several cities in the northern and central regions of the country.In some provinces the mud-stream was 1.5 metres deep. The rain destroyed several bridges, caused problems with electricity supply and locked dozens of people inside their own cars.The elements also caused serious damage to agriculture, The Corriere della Sera reports.70% percent of Venice floodedA combination of heavy rains and strong winds has led to a sharp rise in the water level in the Italian city of Venice.As a result of flooding, or ""high water"", as the locals call it, about 70 percent of the city is flooded.The city authorities have announced a state of emergency and have closed schools, other public institutions and travel routes.The city administration is urging citizens not to leave their homes and to remain on the upper floors.
In addition to Venice, other cities on the west coast of northern Italy have been hit by the unusual weather.
In the region of Tuscany emergency services have already evacuated 200 people from dangerous areas.Storms that hit northern and central Italy at the weekend caused huge damage, washing out roads and isolating towns in southern Tuscany.

Tropical Storm Son-Tinh was moving northeast along the northern Vietnamese coast on Monday after tearing the roofs off hundreds of houses and breaching flood defenses overnight, the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.
Son-Tinh was at typhoon level when it thumped into northern Vietnam late Sunday with winds as strong as 133 kilometers per hour (83 mph). It left three people dead and two injured, according to an initial estimate from the Office of the National Search and Rescue Committee reported by (VNA).
More than a 1,300 rescue workers and soldiers have been deployed to work with local authorities on search and rescue efforts in the aftermath of the storm, VNA said.
Helicopters were on standby for a search and rescue mission for an oil rig with 35 people on board that became disconnected from its towboats miles out at sea amid strong waves generated by the storm, according to VNA.
And five people were missing Sunday after winds from Son-Tinh sank an engineering vessel near a cargo terminal in Sanya, a city on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.

Some of the areas hardest hit said this week they did not have the funds in municipal budgets to deal with the damage from the floods, which claimed at least 12 lives.

Some areas received more than 400mm of rain over just a few days, resulting in roads and bridges washing away, houses and buildings being damaged, and many people being displaced.

Eastern Cape education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said seven schools, mostly primary schools, had reported being damaged last weekend. Teaching had however continued this week, since the damage had been mostly partial.

The provincial government has started proceedings to declare the province a disaster area, while some municipalities have already made disaster declarations on a local level.

Shane Brown, acting head of safety and security for Nelson Mandela Bay, which includes Port Elizabeth, said damage estimates of between R300 million and R600m had been received.

Most of the damage was on an infrastructural level, including to roads, bridges and stormwater systems.

He said the mayoral committee had recommended that the area be declared a disaster area, but added that this was also being done on a provincial level.

Assistance had been rendered to more than 4 000 people between the start of the rains last week and yesterday morning. Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Zanoxolo Wayile said earlier this week that “the impact [of the floods] on the municipal budget will be devastating”.

Ted Pillay, municipal manager of the Cacadu district municipality, said five of the nine local municipalities which fall under its control had been severely affected.

The Ndlambe municipality, which includes Port Alfred, Kenton-on-Sea and Bathurst, had been hardest hit, with major damage to roads and municipal and provincial infrastructure. Severe damage to homes in the poorer areas as well as the more affluent areas had been recorded, and those whose homes were flooded, or in some cases “flattened”, were being housed in community halls.

The Makana municipality, which includes Grahamstown, was next hardest hit, with the majority of damage done to the road network.

Pillay said some homes had experienced some flooding, but that no one was forced from their homes as a result.

In Kouga, which includes Jeffreys Bay and St Francis Bay, the biggest damage was also done to roads. A bridge in St Francis Bay was washed away, leaving residents cut off. “

The ATMs are starting to run out of money there, and the petrol stations are running out of fuel,” he said.

In the Sunday’s River and Koukamma municipalities, access roads had been “terribly affected”, Pillay added. This presented a “big problem” because these were major agricultural areas.

Huge damage to the N2 near Grahamstown would take months to fix, he said, adding that it was possible the road would need to be realigned, since it would be difficult to fill the damaged portions.

The R72 in the Ndlambe area was damaged in three different places, and repair work was currently under way.

Only light vehicles could use the road, meaning trucks had to take long detours.

In addition, Pillay said, the road closures and damages meant residents were spending more on fuel because some of the detours were “hundreds of kilometres long”, forcing taxi fares up too.

Ndlambe, Kouga and Sunday’s River had all declared themselves disaster areas, while the Cacadu district municipality had declared disasters in all five municipalities.

Pillay estimated the combined damage for his municipality and the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality could equal or exceed R1bn.

Earlier this week, Eastern Cape MEC for Local Government and Traditional Affairs Mlibo Qoboshiyane said the damage was likely to carry a price tag of more than R1bn, with damage in Nelson Mandela Bay estimated at R600m. Early estimates for Ndlambe and Kouga municipalities released this week were R500m and R97m respectively.

“Local government doesn’t have a budget of this magnitude, and you declare a state of disaster because you need national help,” Pillay said.",1,0,3999,1.5,109,37,3471,1008,News

Officials in the northern Ontario town of Wawa estimate that damage from a record amount of flooding in the area will run into the tens of millions of dollars.
The town has been under a state of emergency since late Thursday, when heavy rains washed out the area’s main roadways and damaged the local hospital as well as a car dealership, which crumbled into a large sinkhole.
In a statement released Saturday afternoon, town officials said that while the rain stopped some 36 hours ago, “the runoff continues to cause severe problems” as they go about assessing the extent of the damage.
“Wawa is a large area, and we are now only beginning to understand the depth of the damage due to this flooding,” Wawa Mayor Linda Nowicki said in the statement.
Nowicki said she has asked the province for “materials and equipment” to help repair local roadways. The mayor has requested that the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing declare Wawa a disaster area so the town may qualify for extra assistance.
The ministry told The Canadian Press that it is reviewing the town’s circumstances and communicating with local officials.
None of the town’s 3,000 residents was injured in the flooding. However, the heavy rains caused a creek to overflow and wash out a large section of Highway 17, which leads into town.
The main road through town, Highway 101, was closed, as was another road that leads to the nearby Michipicoten First Nation, a community of 700 people southwest of Wawa.
""They have no access in or out,"" Nowicki told The Canadian Press.
An evacuation order was issued for the community, and rescue workers spent Saturday airlifting the elderly and those in need of medical care to Wawa.
The rest of the community is expected to be evacuated in the coming days.
Police said Saturday that phone service, including access to 911, remains out in Dubreuilville, Hawk Junction and Missinabie.
While officials assess the damage, they did say that parts of Highway 17 could reopen within days.
The town said in its statement that the southbound portion leading to Sault Ste. Marie could reopen in two days, while northbound lanes to White River may remain closed for at least another week

Bulldozers are rebuilding the barricades that Sandy's surge knocked down along A1A in Fort Lauderdale, Monday, but residents remain stuck. ""We can't get our cars out, the waves come over the wall, they knock all these dunes down by the time you wake up in the morning, and it takes about four hours for the water to clear, and then it's all sand,"" said Emily Rowe.
Beach front residents have been waking up a whole lot closer to the ocean. ""All of a sudden, sure enough, it's even worse than it was the night before, and we wake up, and it's about a foot higher up our wall,"" said Rowe.
Fortunately, the City of Fort Lauderdale came to the rescue overnight with sandbags for many residents. ""This is ours, this one I made myself, and this is from the city,"" said Isaac Cohens.
Volunteers with the American Red Cross stopped by with sandwiches for those stranded north of Sunrise Boulevard.
On Miami Beach, standing storm surge shut down the Whole Foods on 10th Street between West Avenue and Alton Road. ""In the center of the street in A1A, I mean it was up to about here, and then against the wall on the sidewalk about two to three feet above the sidewalk,"" said Mark Campbell.
Sandy surprised even the most veteran coastal dwellers with her rocky surf. ""Seeing the waves break so far out, I've never seen that before,"" said Rowe.

Water reached about 6.76 feet at high tide this morning at Sewells Point in Norfolk. Forecasters had predicted the crest would be between 6.8 feet and 7.3 feet and that this morning's high tide would be the worst for the duration of the storm. Flooding occurs when the waters reach above 6 feet at Sewells Point.

“The one this morning was the one we had to watch out for,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Orrock.

The next high tide will be about the same “as the highest high tide you’d normally see in a year,” Orrock said. In other words, expect some minor flooding.

By tomorrow afternoon, when winds will shift out of the southwest and start pushing the water out, boaters and residents in low-lying areas should see a lower than normal low tide, Orrock said. Boaters will need to move their vessels before the 4 p.m. low tide, Orrock said.

Three days of strong northerly winds had sucked most of the water out of tidal rivers and creeks, leaving plenty of room for rain runoff      ORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti –  As Americans braced Sunday for Hurricane Sandy, Haiti was still suffering.
Officials raised the storm-related death toll across the Caribbean to 65, with 51 of those coming in Haiti, which was pelted by three days of constant rains that ended only on Friday.
As the rains stopped and rivers began to recede, authorities were getting a fuller idea of how much damage Sandy brought on Haiti. Bridges collapsed. Banana crops were ruined. Homes were underwater. Officials said the death toll might still rise.
""This is a disaster of major proportions,"" Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe told The Associated Press, adding with a touch of hyperbole, ""The whole south is under water.""
The country's ramshackle housing and denuded hillsides are especially vulnerable to flooding. The bulk of the deaths were in the southern part of the country and the area around Port-au-Prince, the capital, which holds most of the 370,000 Haitians who are still living in flimsy shelters as a result of the devastating 2010 earthquake.
Santos Alexis, mayor of the southern city of Leogane, said Sunday that the rivers were receding and that people were beginning to dry their belongings in the sun.
""Things are back to being a little quiet,"" Alexis said by telephone. ""We have seen the end.""
Sandy also killed 11 in Cuba, where officials said it destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of houses. Deaths were also reported in Jamaica, the Bahamas and Puerto Rico. Authorities in the Dominican Republic said the storm destroyed several bridges and isolated at least 130 communities while damaging an estimated 3,500 homes.
Jamaica's emergency management office on Sunday was airlifting supplies to marooned communities in remote areas of four badly impacted parishes.

Floods will likely destroy crops, delay the harvest, and contribute to outbreaks of malaria and other waterborne diseases."" SWALIM, which is managed by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, is working to alert communities about possible floods and how to mitigate their consequences. Mitigating measures include closing intentional breaches in riverbanks, which are used to irrigate crops.

About 200 miles south, in Cooper Landing on the Kenai Peninsula, the Kenai River had yet to crest and the National Weather Service extended a flood warning until Monday afternoon saying that the river will continue rising. Residents of one subdivision were told to be ready to evacuate.
Forecasters said rain would continue falling Sunday, making it tough to predict how high waterways would rise on the peninsula and when they'll crest.
The outlook seemed a bit better in Talkeetna. Rivers and streams draining from the Talkeetna Mountains had crested and water levels fell steadily Friday night, the weather service said. Meteorologists said they don't expect rainfall to significantly increase river levels there, but a flood warning remained in effect for the area as many waterways remained above flood stage.
The Talkeetna River crested at 15.65 feet on Friday, just below the level considered major flooding. It had receded to 12.5 feet by Saturday afternoon, just above the 12-foot flood mark. Only two streets in Talkeetna remained flooded, the Anchorage Daily News reported (http://bit.ly/UDvlWG).
Talkeetna is the last stop for climbers heading to Mount McKinley, North America's tallest mountain. It also has an eclectic population, and has long been purported to be the inspiration for the Alaska town in the TV series, ""Northern Exposure.""
Longtime residents told the Daily News that flooding was the worst they'd seen in more than 30 years. Still, emergency responders said it could've been worse.
""Luckily, we didn't have any buildings float away,"" said Mike Krepel, who runs the Talkeetna Historical Society Museum with his wife, Jenny.
Krepel used a large pump to drain the museum's flooded first floor.
""It blew its way in pretty quick,"" Krepel said. ""We don't think we lost anything important, but we were going pretty hard for several hours.""
Flooding has caused problems over a wide swath of Alaska this week, from Talkeetna to the port town of Seward, 175 miles to the south.
Department of Transportation crews have been working to protect several bridges on the Glenn Highway from fast-moving water. The road is one of two land routes out of populated areas in Anchorage and Wasilla, and the only one in southern Alaska.
The Alaska Railroad was closed through Wednesday as crews repair tracks and bridges, including a 500-foot stretch that was left dangling when the ground beneath it washed out about 35 miles north of Talkeetna.
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened three shelters in recent days, and a fourth was opened Saturday at the state fairgrounds in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage, where evacuees could park recreational vehicles.
Gov. Sean Parnell declared a state disaster Friday for communities hard-hit by recent storms. The declaration covers the Kenai Peninsula Borough, which includes Seward, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which includes Talkeetna, Wasilla and several other towns, the governor's office said.
It was too soon to estimate damage and no injuries have been reported.
""We're just waiting for the next storm to come in, and then we'll start the rodeo all over again,"" said Vickilee Fenster, a spokeswoman for the Mat-Su Borough's Emergency Operations Center""",1,0,3989,1,99,33,3461,1004,News

Just imagine water that has been trapped, about 10 stories high, breaking a barrier and flowing downwards to Abeokuta. You asked what would happen!""What you would have would be a major disaster Just imagine water 10 stories high rushing downwards. It would wipe out everything on its path. That is what would happen should the Oyan Dam collapse and with the way water is being held back by the authorities of the Ogun/Osun River Basin Development Authority, anything can happen"", he warned.The flood management and control expert pointed out that some of the major reasons dams are built are not being addressed by those who should manage the dams.According to Omigbodun, dams are built for purposes of irrigation and power generation, but these dams are not being used for these purposes and the way water is released 'wholesale' makes the ordinarily bad flooding situation worse for Nigerians.He described a similar scenario happening in the north eastern flank of the country where, he said, waters from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon contribute dangerously to the downward river force of the River Benue.""The waters from the Upper Volta into the River Niger and the waters from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon which rush into the River Benue, with the confluence at Lokoja, all come downwards to the Niger Delta and the states of the S/South zone. Yes the situation in that zone is very terrible but it would get worse because the force of the water is still moving downwards""""WARRI/LAGOS, 10 October 2012 (IRIN) - Some 1.3 million Nigerians have been displaced and 431 have died in what the authorities say is the worst flooding in over 40 years, with 30 of the country’s 36 states affected since July, according to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).Heavy rain has submerged much of Delta and Bayelsa states in the southwest, affecting some 350 communities and making 120,000 people homeless, according to the state authorities and the Nigerian Red Cross (NRC).Flooding started in Plateau State in central Nigeria in July, spread through Borno, Cross River, Ebonyi, Nassarawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Katsina and Kebbi states in August, hit Taraba Benue, Niger, Kaduna and Kano in September, before affecting Delta and Bayelsa states in September and October.Thousands of people who had sheltered in dozens of temporary displacement sites in Delta and Bayelsa states have had to flee once again as they have been flooded, forcing agencies to build new ones on higher ground.

As much as 333 millimeters (about 13 inches) of rain, fell in the town of Qinggang, located in Shehong County of Suining City, triggering floods, according to Sichuan Online, the website of Sichuan Daily. It downed power lines and phone lines, as well as disrupted water supplies in some areas in the province.
The central Sichuan city of Suining was hit the hardest, with four reported deaths. Three people were also reported missing. One person was struck by lightning and the others drowned.

During the 2008 earthquake in Sichuan, more than 68,000 people died. Many of the deaths were blamed on poor infrastructure and shoddily constructed buildings.
Ms. Xu of Shehong told The Epoch Times that the county was quickly submerged in chest-high water. Almost every house she saw was flooded. The water level was reported by Sichuan Online to be as high as about 2 feet on some main roads.
Floods washed away a 20-ton oil storage tank in Dongyue Township in Shehong, resulting in an oil leak. A lightning strike triggered an explosion and an accompanying fire, injuring two people.
A local, who declined to be named, told The Epoch Times that heavy rain inundated the city of Mianyang. It started falling Sept. 10 in the early morning and has not stopped yet.

Despite the use of many pumps and other flood-prevention efforts, floodwater levels rose about 50 centimetres in the economic zones of the province.Officials, as of press time, were still struggling to fill breaks and leaks in the embankment along the Yom River. They initially thought their giant sandbags and gabions would be able to block the water from flowing into the town and causing inundation.
The Provincial Waterworks Authority's Sukhothai branch was flooded and tap-water services to locals were disrupted.
The Yom River also damaged earthen embankments in many other areas of Sukhothai's Sri Samrong and Sawankhalok districts, flooding people living in riverside communities.Schools in seriously flooded areas would be closed down temporarily, officials said.A representative of Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya yesterday visited Sukhothai's Muang district to hand out 500 sets of relief items to flood victims.Deputy Sukhothai Governor Smith Palawatwichai said that during the past week, about 6,000 people in Muang Sukhothai Thani Municipality had been hit by the flooding.In his capacity as head of the Water and Flood Management Committee (WFMC), Science Minister Plodprasob Surassawadee yesterday convened a videoconference with officials and 36 provincial governors.The conference took place after Yingluck received reports that the embankment in Sukhothai had been breached again.""The prime minister is worried about the lives and property of people. So, she has constantly monitored the situation,"" Plodprasob said.He said authorities were taking care of all provinces, not just one particular province.""The government is now fighting not just against natural floods but also against people's fears [about possible flooding],"" Plodprasob lamented. ""We are trying to create public confidence in the government's water-management ability.""Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Yongyuth Wichaidit complained that some media outlets were exaggerating the flood situation, especially in Sukhothai.""In fact, it's not as serious as some newspaper headlines have suggested,"" he said.

According to Plodprasob, authorities have mobilised all resources including the latest technologies in tackling the water-related threats. ""The results of our ongoing battle will come out in a month or two,"" he said, adding, ""I believe the situation will not go beyond our control.""

Hydro and Agro Infomatics Institute director Royol Chitdon, who sits on a WFMC subcommittee, said the volume of water in the Yom River in Sukhothai's Sri Satchanalai district had already dropped from 1,500 cubic metres per second to just 1,200 cubic metres. He said the Yom River had overflowed slightly in Sawankhalok district.

""We will be expediting the flow of water into the sea via the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin rivers,"" he said.

On the water situation in Bangkok, Royol said rain would likely continue till today, but would soon ease. ""That means authorities will have time to drain water into the sea before a low-pressure ridge brings more downpours to Bangkok later this month,"" he said.

Bangkok Governor MR Sukhumbhand Paribatra said that in the face of heavy rain, some low-lying areas in the capital could be flooded. He said during the past three days, rainfall ranged between 130 and 150 millimetres.

A total of 10 provinces, out of 77 provinces, mostly in the upper part of the country were hit by flood, Thai authority reported on Saturday morning.

An estimated 642 households have been affected by flooding in the Kenyan districts of Baringo and Marigat, with at least five schools being submerged, according to data from the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS).

The floods have caused latrines to overflow, contaminating water sources. ""I have no better water to drink. I have to use what is readily available, even if I am aware of the risk of contracting diseases,"" Lydiah Kuyale, a resident of Loropil Village in Marigat, told IRIN as she fetched flood water for domestic use.

Kuyale's retail kiosk was among those inundated. But even as her family seeks refuge at a neighbour's house, her main worry is her son's education.

""If the classes remain submerged, how will my son get to school?"" she asked. Her son is set to take the final primary school exam later this year.

Chicken farmer John Ledapana is also assessing his losses after most of his poultry were swept away by the floodwaters, leaving him with only six 3-week-old chicks.

Emergency measures

In Marigat District, two rivers that feed Lake Baringo have breached their banks, overflowing into neighbouring villages. Lake Baringo has extended its banks by up to 1.km, according to the KRCS, which warned that a further 290 families are at risk of displacement if the rains continue.

The agency recommended that the river beds be excavated to improve water retention in the rivers and that dams be constructed upstream to control the volume of water reaching the lake.

According to the KRCS, the affected families are in need of emergency food supplies after at least 26 hectares of maize - which had been ready for harvesting - were destroyed. Fodder, beans and water melon crops have also been ruined.

The delivery of relief items such as medicine, blankets, tents and mosquito nets has been hampered by poor road conditions.

Medical supplies and equipment have also been destroyed by floodwaters in some dispensaries, even as affected populations are threatened by waterborne diseases. ""We can only go to the district hospital in Marigat, but it is hard to raise the 400 Kenya shillings (US$ 4.7) transport expenses,"" said a resident.

It’s worrying. There is fear of an outbreak of certain diseases and food insecurity as a result of the heightened rains and flooding,” Ugandan State Minister for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Musa Ecweru told IRIN. 
“Several areas have been cut off. People are uprooting their food crops from the gardens due to fear of them getting rotten. This is going to cause food insecurity and starvation in a few months.” 
Ecweru said that the impassable roads have hindered access to some of the treatment centres for patients suffering from nodding disease in the region.In 1996, as the Ugandan government fought the Lord’s Resistance Army rebellion, almost the entire population of the Acholi region was compelled to move into overcrowded and poorly serviced “protected villages”.They only began to return to their homes in significant numbers 6 years ago. Since then, many international aid agencies have left or scaled down their presence in the region as the level of emergency humanitarian need declined.“We are working with the ministries of health, works, education, agriculture, water and environment to respond to the situation,” said Ecweru, adding that the government was going to dispatch immediate relief items such as medicines and disinfectant to prevent disease outbreaks.

Neighbouring regions such as Karamoja, Lango and Teso have similarly been affected by the rains, which started in early July and increased in intensity in late August. 

“The situation [in Acholi region] is marked by increasing desperation while more suffering is anticipated,” said Jackson Odong, a research and advocacy officer at the Makerere University, who is based in Acholi.

“The families whose shelters were destroyed currently live in debilitating conditions. Shelter kits containing tarpaulins, buckets, mosquito nets, blankets and tents are a necessity,” he told IRIN.

The floods have also affected the reopening of several schools. 

Augustine Asiire, the Agago resident district commissioner, said other urgent needs included food, utensils, safe water and portable latrines. She named the worst affected areas in her district as Adilang, Kalongo, Lamio, Omot, Paimol, Parabongo and Wol.

The floods are likely to negatively affect several reconstruction programmes in the region such as the National Agricultural Advisory Services, the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund and other projects under northern Uganda's Peace, Recovery and Development Plan, according to a late August rapid assessment by Makerere University's Refugee Law Project.

This assessment warned that perennial flooding in the region could precipitate further conflict. 

“Affected communities have to cope with neighbouring households displaced and searching for shelter, grazing land, food items, land for cultivation and source [s] of livelihood generally,” it said.

“Returning to camps could instigate an increase in land disputes, as vacant land invites encroachment and illegal land grabbing,” the assessment added.

An estimated 50,000 households, comprising about 300,000 people, were affected by flooding in 2007 in northern Uganda.

Tropical Cyclone,Korea, Dem P Rep: Typhoon Bolaven hit the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea on 28 Aug 2012, worsening the extensive flooding caused by successive torrential rains and tropical storms since July. Preliminary information released by the government indicate that as of 3 Sep, at least 59 persons are dead, 5,766 houses have been destroyed or damaged and 2192 houses are submerged. Up to 52,299 hectares of crop land were submerged, buried or washed away, aggravating the food situation in the country..South offers to help flood-hit North Korea

South Korea has proposed sending emergency relief aid to North Korea, the first such offer since relations sank into a deep freeze after the death of the North's leader last December.
The South's Red Cross chief sent a proposal on Monday, calling for talks with North Korea on aid shipment, the Unification Ministry, which handles cross-border affairs, said on Friday.
Official aid from the South to the North often goes through the Red Cross as a matter of formality.

South Korea last sent such aid two years ago, although civilian groups have been allowed to ship aid to the impoverished North despite high cross-border tensions.
.

Pyongyang's state news agency said earlier that floods in June and July left 569 people dead or missing and washed away or inundated 65 280 hectares of cropland.

A strong typhoon which hit the Korean peninsula last Tuesday killed 48 people and damaged at least 50 000ha of farmland in the North, it said on Monday.

North Korea suffers chronic food shortages, with the situation exacerbated by floods, droughts and mismanagement. During a famine in the mid to late-1990s, hundreds of thousands died. win typhoons renewed fears of a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where poor drainage, widespread deforestation and crumbling infrastructure can turn even a routine rainstorm into a catastrophic flood.

Typhoon Bolaven struck the North on Tuesday and Wednesday, submerging houses and roads, ruining thousands of acres of crops and triggering landslides that buried train tracks – scenes that are all too familiar in this disaster-prone nation. A second major storm, Typhoon Tembin, pounded the Korean Peninsula with more rains Thursday before dissipating.

The storms came with North Korea still recovering from earlier floods that killed more than 170 people and destroyed thousands of homes. That in turn followed a springtime drought that was the worst in a century in some areas.

The disaster relief group AmeriCares announced late Thursday that enough emergency antibiotics and medical supplies to treat 15,000 North Koreans would be airlifted to the country as early as this week in coordination with North Korean officials. Damage to 69 hospitals and clinics suffered during the earlier floods has left 700,000 North Koreans without access to health care at a time when scores are fighting off the threat of infection while living in temporary shelters, the group said in a statement.

Other foreign aid groups said they were standing by in Pyongyang, but had not received new requests for help from the North Korean government. They had little information on the extent of damage and were relying on reports from state media. The country’s wariness toward the outside world, as well as a primitive rural road system, means aid may be slow arriving, if it is allowed to come at all.

“These fresh storms, coming just a few weeks after the serious flooding – they do raise concerns because we see parts of the countryside battered again that have already been left in a vulnerable state,” said Francis Markus, spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in East Asia.

Tembin’s strong winds and hard rain pounded South Korea on Thursday as residents of some cities waded through streets flooded with murky, knee-deep water. The storm moved off the peninsula’s east coast overnight. The national weather agency in Seoul predicted some cities in southern North Korea could see up to 80 mm (3.15 inches) of rain, but North Korea didn’t immediately release details on rainfall, deaths or damage from the latest storm.

The earlier storm, Bolaven, left 20 people dead or missing in South Korea. It killed three people and left 3,300 people homeless in North Korea, the country’s official media reported.""",1,South Korea,3979,1.5,89,29,3451,1000,News

He said the dead included university students serving required youth service time after their graduation.
Mijinyawa said the flooding came after neighboring Cameroon released water from a dam. Officials say flooding in neighboring Adamawa state, also blamed on the water release from the dam, has killed at least 15 people in recent days.
Nigerian emergency management officials say Cameroon alerted Nigeria before opening the dam.
Nigeria also is experiencing its annual rainy season. Flooding recently killed at least 68 people in Plateau state in central Nigeria.

Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- Flooding in Cameroon's Far North Region has killed nearly 30 people and affected more than 26,000 others, officials said Monday.
More than 4,000 people in the Logone and Shari division were displaced, and more than 22,000 people in the region of Maga, Mayo-Danay division, also have been affected.
Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary described the flooding as ""a calamity,"" and he called for urgent action to save lives, livestock and property. Dana FM, a local radio station, said the death toll will grow as bodies are collected and identified. For the past few weeks, there has been no sign of the flood easing.
The floodwaters have submerged areas like Benoue, Faro, Louti and Mayo. Homes, crops and barns have been destroyed and herds of livestock killed. Heavy rainfall that has lasted nearly a month has fractured the Lagdo Dam, causing the Benoe River to flood nearby villages.
Cameroon's government has dispatched a military contingent to the area to help and evacuate victims, and the government of Morocco sent food and other aid Saturday.
Aid agencies like Plan International Cameroon and the United Nations Population Fund are concerned about the potential spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and malaria. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized, and tents have been erected to house victims.
Demian Toh, a Red Cross official, told CNN that food supplies are running low and the tents are inadequate for the tens of thousands of displaced flood victims. Toh said there were serious concerns about malnutrition among women and children.
In 2010, flooding in northern Cameroon triggered an outbreak of cholera that claimed nearly 6,000 lives, according to official estimates.
In neighboring Nigeria, dozens of dead bodies have been found floating in remote areas of Adamawa state. Officials there are blaming Cameroon for not alerting them before excess water was released from the Lagdo Dam.
The disaster is being called the worst flooding in Cameroon in more than 60 years. Opposition party member Paul Ayah Abine said the casualties and the insufficient aid given to the thousands of victims show clearly that the government has a fragile emergency unit that cannot predict and respond quickly to natural disasters.
August 27, 2012: ""Flooding this rainy season in various parts of Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with some 160 million people, had already killed dozens. The toll includes more than 60 people left dead in two separate floods in Plateau state in the country's centre.Seasonal flooding also affects the west African region, with 2010 having been a particularly harsh year.

Heavy rains that flooded the Niger River along the northern border of the West African nation of Benin have killed at least four people and destroyed farmland, officials said on Monday.

News of casualties and flood damage in Benin came after authorities in neighbouring Niger announced last week that at least 52 people had been killed and nearly 400,000 displaced by flooding there since mid-July.

""Four people have already lost their lives following flooding in certain areas of northern Benin (Karimama and Malanville), along the border with Niger, due to strong rains which led to the overflowing of the Niger River,"" the interior ministry said in a statement.

Interior Minister Benoit Degla said a number of hectares of farmland had been destroyed and warned the situation could worsen.

Four people are missing, down from eight earlier, according to Freddy Roman, a spokesman for the local Red Cross.
The government has declared a ""yellow alert"" in various parts of Cartago, a central province where one person was reported dead, said Roman. The person was rescued after a landslide, but died on the way to the hospital from injuries and heart failure, he said.
A yellow alert is also in effect for parts of Limon, an eastern province.
More than 1,500 people have taken refuge at shelters and others are waiting to be rescued, according to the Red Cross.

In June, the United Nations said two-thirds of the country's 24 million people were facing chronic food shortages.The World Food Program said earlier this week that it is sending emergency food aid to the North's flood-ravaged parts.
In a statement published on its website on Friday, the United Nations aid body said the emergency assistance will provide the flood victims in the destitute country ""with an initial ration of 400 grams of maize per day for 14 days."" It did not say when the food would arrive in North Korea.

Another 400 people have gone missing in the floods that hit four regions of the country and destroyed crops in an area of 65,000 hectares.UN experts, who came to North Korea this week to estimate damages, consider that the country is likely to face hunger due to crops losses.Under UN estimates, about two thirds of the population in North Korea faces shortage of food and pure water.The floods, caused by recent downpours and typhoons, also hit North Korean mining industry as water flooded tens of coal mines in two large coal deposits in the country's north.

Residents clambered onto rooftops to escape the rising waters and resorted to traveling by boat.Since late June, 169 people have been killed, 400 were left missing and some 212,200 people were homeless due to flooding, state media reported Saturday. Vast swaths of farmland remain submerged, possibly threatening the harvest in a country already suffering from food shortages, the United Nations said.Anju was inundated with 40 centimeters (16 inches) of rain on July 29 and 30, state media said. It was among the three hardest-hit areas in North Korea, with 45 percent of the city's population affected, the U.N. resident coordinator's office in Pyongyang said Thursday after making field visits to flood-stricken regions. Some 36,000 Anju families do not have clean water and nearly two-thirds of the region's farmland was flooded, the U.N. said.The U.N. called for immediate food assistance, and said providing clean water
and health care were crucial to preventing an outbreak of diseases following the breakdown of water supply systems and the flooding of wells. The first shipment of U.N. emergency food aid was being distributed, the World Food Program said Saturday.On Saturday, AP reporters who traveled to Anju found a city in recovery mode on a sunny day.Residents lined up with buckets to receive clean water from Red Cross Society officials clad in red vests.

He warned that there is a chance of an outbreak of disease among people still drinking contaminated water.U.N. and other international organizations are providing emergency items, such as tents, but they are not reaching people in some flooded areas because access to roads and railways hasn't been restored, North Korean officials said.In addition to running out of emergency supplies, the Red Cross was bracing for more heavy rainfall expected in the next few days, Red Cross Society official Yu Ju Yong told AP.The torrential rain follows a period of protracted drought that has raised concerns about the effect the severe weather will have on the country's farms"" .July 30, 2012: ""Hong Kong (CNN) -- Heavy rain across large swathes of North Korea has caused widespread flooding and killed dozens of people, state media reported, with warnings of more damage still to come.The downpours have been rolling over the impoverished country for more than a week, sweeping away crops and destroying buildings, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in reports over the weekend. As of Saturday, 88 people had died and 134 had been injured, KCNA said.

A deal earlier this year for the United States to ship food aid to the country fell apart after the regime went ahead with a controversial rocket launch.
The highest numbers of deaths so far from the flooding were reported in areas of South Phyongan province, northeast of the capital, Pyongyang.
The heavy rains Sunday hit Pyongyang, as well as North and South Phyongan provinces. The capital is the richest and most developed part of the country, used as a showcase by the secretive, nuclear-armed regime. The provinces tend to be poorer and have weaker infrastructure.

A CATASTROPHIC flash flood that killed at least 164 people in southern Russia on July 7th may have been exacerbated by badly planned road construction, according to scientists studying satellite images of the disaster.The flood, in which an estimated 50 million cubic metres of water swept through the southern town of Krymsk, was the first significant natural disaster of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s third term.The government’s response has been strongly criticised, with the emergency situations ministry saying last week that residents had not been properly warned of the impending floodwater, despite an alarm system that highlighted the danger at least four hours previously.The main cause of the flood was record rainfall, with at least 221mm of rain in the 24 hours beforehand. However, many Krymsk residents believe a discharge of water from the Neberdzhaisk reservoir, south of the town, could have caused the flood, or at least contributed to its strength.The popular hypothesis is that water was released intentionally from the reservoir to prevent water from overflowing into another nearby town.Lev Denisov, head of the laboratory of remote sensing at the Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has another theory which experts say offers a more probable explanation.The flood’s force, he said, was caused by water being channelled through small openings in a raised highway south of the city.Using photographs taken from the International Space Station, his team pieced together the path of the floodwater, which he said built up behind a seven-metre-high road embankment south of the town, as well as a raised railway, by late evening on July 6th.The waters were held back by logjams of debris, which temporarily clogged eight narrow bridge openings.“When the pressure became too high, the debris clogs burst, unleashing this wall of water,” Mr Denisov said.He said the height of the flood water was similar to the height of the highway embankment – seven metres – and dismissed the theory that the floods were caused deliberately.He criticised the construction of the highway and railway, however, which he said should have had wider bridge openings to prevent the build-up of floodwater. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2012)""...As informed earlier, the July 7 floods inundated close to 5,000 homes in the Krai’s three cities—Gelendzhik, Krymsk, and Novorossiysk—and several villages.

The authorities admitted people were given little warning about the impending disaster.“Not all of the population was warned in due time,” Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov told a meeting Monday. “Mistakes were made by local authorities and certain departments.”President Vladimir Putin ordered an inquiry after flying over the affected area in a helicopter Saturday. Police have launched a separate investigation into whether the deaths were caused by negligence.It was the worst disaster since Putin was elected for a third term in a disputed poll earlier this year. TV footage showed thousands of homes in the town almost completely submerged, with residents forced to take refuge in trees or on rooftops. Krasnodar region Governor Alexander Tkachyov has dismissed allegations that the seven-meter waves flood was caused by the opening of sluice gates at a local reservoir.Most of the deaths occurred in Krymsk, a town of some 57,000, but casualties were also reported in the Black Sea resort of Gelendzhik and the port town of Novorossiysk.More than 22,000 people were affected by the floods, and around 5,000 homes inundated, authorities said."".",1,0,3943,2,53,21,3415,992,News

The Anclote rose from 9 feet (2.7 metres) before Debby's approach to more than 27 feet (8.2 metres) on Tuesday, well above major flood level, Pasco County spokesman Eric Keaton saidWater was ankle-deep to head-high in the evacuation area.

Nearly 20 inches (51 cm) of rain has fallen in two days on Wakulla County, a Gulf Coast county famed for its natural springs. Roads were under water in many parts of the surrounding ""Big Bend"" area where the Florida Panhandle meets the peninsula.

Parts of Interstate 10 were closed between the capital, Tallahassee, and the Atlantic coast city of Jacksonville. The storm left 29,000 people without power across the central and northern parts of the state, emergency managers said.

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre said Debby could bring another 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) of rain and possibly tornadoes to north Florida and southeast Georgia in the next two days.

Debby's top winds weakened to 40 miles per hour (65 km per hour), just over the threshold to remain a tropical storm. It was expected to weaken further as the centre moved ashore, but could strengthen back into a tropical storm as it crossed into the Atlantic Ocean, the forecasters said.

The centre of circulation was still in the Gulf of Mexico, about 35 miles (55 km) west-northwest of Cedar Key, Florida. But Debby was a large and ragged storm and most of the thunderstorms and rain were northeast of the centre, already over Florida.

Tropical storm warnings were in effect for much of Florida's Gulf coast and could be extended inland as the storm moves slowly east over the state in the next few days.

Debby spawned twisters that killed a woman, badly injured a child and wrecked homes in central Florida in rural Highlands County on Sunday. Florida's coastal Pinellas County was also hit hard, with flooding in some areas and at least 20 houses with roofs that were partially or fully blown off during a tornado-like storm.",1,0,3938,2,48,19,3410,990,News

A senior member of the Assam Human Rights Commission, a government body, told Reuters it suspects millions of dollars meant for flood control have been siphoned off by state water department officials in the last five years. The commission has demanded a high-level investigation by the government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who represents Assam in the upper house of parliament, called the floods the worst in recent times and promised $1,800 to each victim's family in compensation. Critics say that much of the money will evaporate.""Corruption is rampant before and after a flood,"" said Arup Misra, a prominent environmental activist in the state and a professor at Assam Engineering College. ""Some officials eagerly wait for floods as they could make money on repairing of embankments and relief distribution.""Over the past 60 years successive governments have built levees along most of the length of the volatile Brahmaputra, which is Assam's main river and is fed by Himalayan snow melt and some of the world's heaviest rainfall. Experts say these embankments are both criminally under-maintained and a discredited form of flood management.Assam is famed as a tea-growing region and rich in oil and timber. It is also home to the Kaziranga National Park that hosts two-thirds of the world's Great One-horned Rhinoceroses.LEVEE BREACH DESTROYS HOMESNearly a decade ago, Hannan Sikdar's father lost his home and farm to floods in Assam. On June 28, the same fate struck Sikdar and his family of 10 when the Brahmaputra burst through a dike and swept away their home and everything they owned in the middle of the night.Assam's population is on the rise, and like millions of others, Sikdar lived in a danger zone right next to the river's mud embankment. Millions of dollars were assigned to keep levees in good shape. But in eight years living there, Sikdar says nobody even came to talk about the risks.""This was the place where we made our home when my father lost his property several years ago,"" said the 30-year-old, looking down at the wreckage of his bamboo and wood house from a new makeshift hut further along the embankment.""We were never told that this embankment could break.""Rajiv Sinha, an expert on river dynamics, said the levees prevent the river from spreading silt in its natural flood plain, causing the river to clog up and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods. Similar embankments downstream in Bangladesh have also been blamed for devastating flooding.""In the last fifty years, two things have happened -- the expenditure on flood control has increased tremendously, and at the same time the damage caused by floods has also increased exponentially,"" said Sinha, who teaches geosciences at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur.Globally, flood management trends are moving away from levee-type measures to natural storage areas such as swamps and wetlands. But Assam has failed to come up with any modern, long-term plan to harness the river.Entire villages, such as the one Sikdar belonged to, have cropped up in flood-prone areas and their only layer of protection is a neglected, crumbling mud wall.As heavy rains continue, officials fear a second spell of floods soon, but victims such as Hanan Sikdar continue to live in tiny straw and tin shelters next to the broad river.""People are living in danger zones out of compulsion,"" said Chandan Talukdar relief worker with Sikdar. ""Till alternative land is found, these people will remain on embankments"" .July 9, 2012:  Assam on Monday reeled under the impact of floods with the Brahmputra and its tributaries playing havoc in 27 districts of the state affecting nearly 24 lakh people and taking the death toll to 124.

Each rainy season this stokes fear and panic among residents who fear that their homes may be destroyed, and that they may be drowned in the floods.Dr. Saif Al-Hakimi, a professor in environment and earth sciences at Sana’a University, attributes the strong floods in Sana’a to the streets being asphalted or paved with stones. He argues that the water can not sink into the soil, and therefore it accumulates and is channeled with disastrous results.There are further concerns of a potential environment disaster due to the accumulated  piles of garbage in Yemeni governorates. Cleaners and garbage collectors have been on strike since last week, and rubbish has piled up across many cities.Floods have swept trash along streets and through neighborhoods, polluting the surface of the earth and water in wells, said Al-Hakimi. He added that contamination of the soil could increase the chances of contracting disease, especially in children.The National Center for Meteorology (NCM) on Tuesday warned people to take precautions against thunderstorms, flash flooding, and landslides.The director of the predictions department at the NCM, Rashid Al-Ariqi, predicted that heavy rains will continue from Sa’ada in the far north to Taiz in the south. He said there was a possibility that the rains may extend east in the coming days towards Shabwa, Marib, and Al-Jawf governorates, and west towards the Hodeida and Taiz coasts.

It’s been raining hard in West Africa, and the media is overflowing with stories of the destruction caused by the deluges and resulting floods.The bad weather has caused some deaths, and rendered hundreds homeless across the region. It has also triggered a spike in the price of local culinary delights, including fish.For instance, in Senegal, a storm at sea and days of torrential rainfall have discouraged fishermen from sailing into the Atlantic, making fish more expensive in local markets, Senegalese media have reported.Most canoes have been packed away, and those fishermen who dare to brave the turbulent seas have increased the price they charge retailers for their catch.“They (fishermen) sell us the thiof (a type of fish) at 3,500 FCFA ($7.60) and we resell at 4,000 ($8.70) or 5,000 FCFA ($10.90).  That is why we have very few customers these days,” said Fatou Sall, a retailer at a Dakar fish market.In Dakar’s suburbs, residents driven from their homes by floodwaters have protested against what they perceive as a lack of investment by the government to help them cope with annual floods, Walf Adjiri TV has reported.Senegal has suffered recurring floods in the past decade, which force tens of thousands of people out of their homes each year.Experts say the more extreme rainfall could be linked to the effects of climate change in West Africa, and have urged governments to develop strategies to adapt to weather and climate shifts.CALLS FOR BETTER TOWN PLANNINGThey have also called on local authorities to improve town planning, including constructing drainage systems, while ensuring that people don’t settle in swampy areas and on waterways.Some seem to be acting on that advice. The council chairman of Sunam village in northeastern Nigeria, for example, has advised hundreds of people whose homes were destroyed by flooding to stop blocking up waterways with refuse.Five people were killed and hundreds uprooted by torrential rains and floods in the village in Nigeria’s Adamawa State, the Nigerian Tribune reported on Wednesday.Meanwhile, in Cameroon, severe flooding after a heavy downpour on Monday surprised inhabitants of the capital, leaving several motorists marooned until passers-by pushed them to safety, the government-run Cameroon Tribune newspaper said.And in Burkina Faso, two days of heavy  rains struck fear into residents of Simonville, a neighbourhood in the capital Ouagadougou, reviving memories of the country’s worst-ever flooding in September 2009, the Observateur Paalga newspaper reported.“Although this (torrential rainfall) was not a tsunami, it induced cold sweat among residents who say they are scared every time there are dark clouds in the sky,” the paper said..""",1,Camaroun,3901,1,12,4,3374,975,News

Roads and bridges leading to Nsanje, 175 kilometres (110 miles) from the commercial capital Blantyre, had been washed away, cutting off 30 villages.He said the helicopter and engine boat operation to rescue the villagers started on Tuesday. Only 99 villagers have been flown to safety and were being housed in schools and churches where the government was distributing food and relief items. No deaths were reported, but hundreds of hectares of the maize fields were under water and scores of cattle, goats and chickens had been washed away, he added.The district is prone to floods every year and thousands of villagers defy government orders to move to higher land because they want to grow crops in river banks after the floods, which leave soil rich in silt. SAPA..Johannesburg - Five municipalities in the Ehlanzeni district of Mpumalanga have been declared disaster areas, a provincial official said on Friday.They are the Mbombela, Nkomazi, Umjindi, Thaba Chweu, and Bushbuckridge municipalities.Traditional affairs spokesperson Simphiwe Kunene said Premier David Mabuza had made the declaration after 1 452 households were damaged by storms and flooding between January 16 and January 19.Of these, about 330 households were severely affected - 130 in Bushbuckridge, 74 in Nkomazi, 59 in Mbombela, 40 in Umjindi and 27 in Thaba Chweu.Kunene said his department was helped by the department of social development and Ehlanzeni district municipality to provide food, blankets, and shelter to those affected.Seven deaths were recorded in the province during the flooding.Major infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools, and agriculture installations, were also damaged in the extreme weather.The cost to repair infrastructure was estimated at R445.7m.Rebuilding roads and bridges would be the most expensive at an estimated cost of R266m.The provincial government provided just over R36m in the short-term and the municipalities contributed R25.7m towards rebuilding.Kunene said Mabuza would engage with the national government for the balance. January 6, 2011: ""AFP Mozambique: Flooding from Tropical Storm Dando kills 5, displaces thousands...Reuters) - Flooding in southeast Africa this week has killed at least five people, forced thousands to evacuate homes in Mozambique and led to an airlift of about 20 foreign tourists at South Africa's flagship Kruger National Park, officials said Thursday.The damage was heaviest in Mozambique, which reported the deaths.

""If the latter catches up with the former, there won't be any rooftops left to see above the floodwaters,"" he said, repeating an earlier appeal for people to leave all inundated areas.The weather service's flood forecasting section said water levels on the tributaries of major central Luzon rivers were rising fast. These could bring floods to the 150km-long central Luzon floodplain.Mr Ramos said there was now less danger from the equally vast Cagayan River basin in the northeast because residents of vulnerable areas had left ahead of Nalgae's approach, though he said he did not know the exact number of evacuees.His agency listed 180,000 evacuees, mostly victims displaced by Nesat.The only death so far caused by Nalgae was from a landslide that struck a van near the northern mountain town of Bontoc, Mr Ramos said.He said it was still too dangerous for his people to go out to assess the extent of the damage in other areas.

Heavy rains in the West African nation destroyed nearly a thousand houses, flooded fields, killed five people and washed away livestock in August.  “Although there is the need for food and shelter, the situation does not seem to be a crisis,” OCHA said on Wednesday.The rains follow recent concerns about drought which could have led to a poor harvest and food shortages in parts of the country. Last month, the government urged people to pray for rain after erratic rainfall in several parts of Niger.Niger, located in West Africa’s arid Sahel region that runs south of the Sahara desert, depends on rain-fed agriculture for its food needs and has a history of food shortages and nutrition crises. In recent years it has also experienced flooding due to torrential rains""..Collapsed buildings, flooded-out rice paddies: the floods in Niger are not as spectacular as those in Pakistan, but they spell disaster for a people already stricken by a food crisis.Zarmagandaye, Lamorde and Karadje are three districts of the west African country's capital Niamey which have turned into marshland since the beginning of August.Under the ruins of homes built of clay, cats gnaw on the bodies of dead grey lizards, while a handful of children come to splash around in the deserted streets.On Monday, torrential rain brought down the few buildings still left upright three weeks after the Niger river, the third biggest in Africa, burst its banks in the worst recorded floods since 1929.""The bustling districts have now turned into ghost towns, we've never seen the like in living memory,"" Abdou Ganda, an elderly fisherman, said.The United Nations has registered more than 17,000 homeless people in the capital. Only half of them, currently sheltered in schools, have received food, blankets and mosquito nets provided by international organisations.The Niamey-based Niger Basin Authority (ABN), which groups the nine nations crossed by the river and its tributaries, attributes the rise in the river's level to exceptionally heavy rain in neighbouring states such as Mali and Burkina Faso.""We made little of the rising water level and were surprised in our sleep,"" said Mariama, a widow with nine children who lost everything when their home collapsed.According to Niger's Early Warning System (SAP) and catastrophe management officials, the whole of the country, including the perenially arid desert of the northern Agadez region, has been affected by flooding caused by heavy rain.The SAP and UN agencies have estimated that almost 200,000 people have no homes in the eight regions of Niger, where at least seven people have died since the start of the catastrophe, according to media reports.""It's a double catastrophe: before the rain, the people lacked food, now the few reserve stocks of cereal have been washed away by the water. There's nothing left,"" said Ibrahim Mahaman, a village chief cited by the Oxfam aid organisation.More than seven million people in Niger face food shortages in a serious crisis because of a major shortfall in the crop harvest for 2009-2010, according to the UN.In Niamey, while the floodwaters are gradually pulling back, the meteorological office has forecast heavy rain until mid-September.""",1,0,3862,1.5,96,42,3337,965,News

The storm, which was a hurricane for days before weakening to tropical storm status earlier Sunday, was blamed for at least 19 deaths across seven states. The U.S. government estimated that the cost from wind damage alone is expected to top $1 billion, with downed power lines leaving more than 4 million people without electricity. ""I want people to understand that this is not over,"" President Barack Obama said Sunday evening from Washington. ""The impacts of this storm will be felt for some time, and the recovery effort will last for weeks or longer."" Some of the biggest, continuing headaches related to flooding, as tidal storm surges and overflowing, fast-moving rivers left homes in North Carolina and points northward awash. Flood warnings and watches were in effect Sunday night for much of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, eastern New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Numerous ""swift-water"" rescue teams were dispatched Sunday night around Vermont, where state emergency management spokesman Mark Bosma said some small towns were ""entirely covered with water"" and people, including a woman who was in labor, were stranded in schools and cars. Vermont State Police Capt. Ray Keefe said that Wilmington is ""cut off,"" hundreds of roads had been closed, and some homes were washed off foundations and into lakes. And ""conditions continue to worsen dramatically"" in Vermont's capital of Montpelier, city manager William Fraser said Sunday night, noting National Weather Service warnings of rising river waters that will cause ""major flooding"" downtown early Monday morning. ""The conditions today have been awful,"" Bosma said. ""Water is pretty much everywhere."" Also hard-hit was New Jersey, where initial fears about coastal flooding -- which had prompted the evacuation of more than 1 million people from the shore -- had given way to fresh concerns about inland flooding. That left many residents like Guy Pascarello, whose family's Secaucus home of 40 years was declared uninhabitable after it became inundated by three-foot-high waters, trying to figure out what to do next. ""I don't know (what we'll do), this is all new ground,"" Pascarello said. ""The good news is that it's just stuff. This is a home and we love our home, but it's just things."" Even locations well inland, like Princeton Junction about halfway between New York City and Princeton, had waters as high as 12 feet that covered roads and bridges, resident Edward Picco said. And streets in downtown Millburn saw major flooding when the Rahway River overflowed early Sunday morning, said Lt. Peter Eakley, the town's deputy emergency management coordinator. ""It's crazy. ... The water is moving between buildings, up, down, all sorts of different directions,"" Rich Graessle told CNN's iReport from Millburn.Along the shore in Long Beach, New York, water poured underneath the boardwalk and into the city's downtown. Outside Philadelphia, meanwhile, waters climbed to street-sign levels in Darby, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said, with the water sending ""couches, furniture, all kinds of stuff floating down the street."" Two buildings collapsed in Philadelphia, Nutter told reporters, but no one was injured. One family paid tribute to the storm by naming their child, born at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Manuel Hurricane Cooper, said Riddle Hospital spokeswoman Bridget Therriault in Media, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia. Those living around the Gilboa Dam in upstate New York, about 50 miles southwest of Albany, were told to evacuate Sunday afternoon due to concerns that the dam could be overwhelmed by ""higher-than-predicted amounts of rain."" Further south in New York City, officials worked Sunday night to return the city to normal. Hours earlier, the Hudson River overflowed in lower Manhattan, receding only after massive amounts of water spilled over jogging paths and into at least one nearby apartment building.

Sinha, adding that about 70,000 people were homeless and around 300,500 hectares of mainly rice paddy had been destroyed"" August 25, 2011: ""In Bihar, two and a half days of floods have been turned into a two-and-a-half-month-long affair so that the politics over relief continues, says one of India's leading river researchers.Solutions to tackle the recurring 'man-made' floods lie in a dialogue between the residents of flood-prone plains, the technical fraternity and the government, says Dinesh Kumar Mishra.'They have turned two and a half days of floods into a two and a half months' floods so that the politics over relief continues. Flood is a man-made menace,' Mishra, who was in the city to address a seminar 'Dying Rivers, Living Rivers' at the India International Centre, told IANS.A structural engineer from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur, Mishra has written volumes probing the origin of the Kosi, Bagmati, Mahananda and Bodhi Balan rivers and man-made floods in them caused by breaches in embankments.Currently writing a book about the origin and flow of the Gandak, Mishra's work on the Kosi, 'Trapped! Between the Devil & Deep Waters: The Story on Bihar's Kosi River', remains his seminal investigation.Citing examples from Bihar, which has eight major Himalayan rivers and is ravaged by floods every year, Mishra said that studies reveal that people living in the lowlands of Bihar, on an average, suffer for 20 days in a year.'For the rest of the year, they have a nice, flood-free life. Women do not have to walk for miles with pitchers on their heads for drinking water. There is enough ground water in their courtyard. But no one takes note of that.''If water or floods were the problem, then people could not have lived for centuries in harmony with rivers. But, instead of living with rivers on equal terms, people are now empowering the rivers (in the name of taming it) with the more destructive embankments and big dams,' Mishra said.Any dam or embankments on the rivers should be designed to meet indigenous needs, he said.'In Bihar, residents classify floods into five categories. 'Barh' - in which water spills on the embankment, 'Boah', - when the rivers swamps large areas, 'Humma' - when water half submerges the cattle, 'saah'- when the flood water churns in ripples; and 'pralay' - destruction.'People of the state are used to 'barh' and 'boah'; while the other three are rare,' he said.Probing the dynamics of flood relief politics, he said that earlier, the king used to disburse relief during inundation to 'save his own skin'.'Later, the bureaucrats swindled money for relief. Aid has now been a tool to win elections,' he said.Tracing Bihar's historical relationship with the Kosi, he said those living in the lowlands deify the river by calling it 'maiya (mother)'.In 2008, it however became a terror. A breach in the Kosi embankment in Nepal in 2009 inundated large tracts in adjoining Bihar, affecting more than three million people in 16 districts.'For centuries, the residents have worshipped the rivers. But the outsiders who came there (especially the British) could not adjust to the nature of the Kosi and the Damodar. Hence they became rivers of sorrow because the colonisers and the subsequent government could not collect revenue from it,' Mishra said.'Till 1952, the British rulers and their successors had been creating embankments for commercial purposes so that the river did not come to the villages. That created a need for irrigation and opportunity for revenue. They collected revenue for flood protection too,' he said.An estimate by the Bihar government says the eight rivers of the state have breached their embankments 371 times since 1987.The benefits of embankment are very limited, Mishra argued.'The mud (and later concrete) embankments put the rivers between two walls, prevented them from spilling sediments on its banks and disturbed the water balance with confinement. Tributaries could not join the main rivers. They either flowed parallel to the main river and flowed back to the countryside dissipating into a network of channels demanding construction of sluice gates to control the backflow,' he said.The premise is that the sluice gates will remain open during rainy season, but then they don't function and this traps the tributaries.Offering solutions, Mishra said the natural drainage of the river should not be disturbed as far as possible. 'Rivers are known to flow for benefits; they should not be allowed to stagnate,' he said.(Madhusree Chatterjee can be contacted at madhu.c@ians.in)"".August 22, 2011: "" Floods in Bihar have left nearly 1.5 million people in 12 districts struggling to survive under open skies, according to Special Secretary Sunil Kumar of the Disaster Management Department, even as state Chief Minister Nitish Kumar undertook an aerial survey for the second consecutive day.The department said that flood waters had entered more than 1,000 villages in 500 panchayats and rising level of most rivers threatened to inundate many others. The affected villages were in the districts of Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, Munger, Begusarai, Katihar, Araria, Purnia, Saharsa, Darbhanga, Madhepura and Saran.“The floods have badly hit Bhagalpur district,” an official said. Elsewhere in the state, thousands have been forced to take shelter on embankments, highways, in school and other buildings on high ground. “Water entered these villages after levels rose in all major rivers following heavy rains in the state and the catchment areas of Nepal.”In 2008, over three million people were rendered homeless in Bihar when the Kosi river breached its bank upstream in Nepal and changed course. It was said to be the worst flood in the state in the last 50 years.The government has promised to provide one quintal foodgrain to the affected and directed officials of flood-hit districts to open relief camps.According to the Central Water Commission, the Ganges crossed the red mark at several places. Similarly, the Kosi was flowing above the danger mark and Mahananda at other places.Standing crops worth crores of rupees have been damaged and road communication at several places has snapped. “Rising rivers have badly hit paddy cultivation and destroyed standing banana and maize crops in Bhagalpur and other districts,” a commission official said.Meanwhile, Bihar Water Resources Development Minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said all river embankments were safe and there was no need to panic.""While the rivers in North Bihar, notorious for their inundating tendencies, have been on their best behaviour so far this monsoon, it is the Ganga which is giving sleepless nights to villagers and flood relief authorities alike, especially in Bihar's Bhagalpur district....On Thursday, waters of the Ganga breached two revenue embankments in Bhagalpur.The river has exceeded its danger level for the first time since 2003, clambering 34.14 m beyond its tipping point.The 6-km long embankment in Kharik block, in a perilous state since Sunday, finally caved in during the early hours despite efforts to plug the breach using sandbags and boulders.As the day progressed, four spurs holding together the revenue embankment at Gopalpur block, came under severe pressure and finally gave way in the morning.While authorities are yet to take a call on the exact area afflicted, more than three dozen villages under the Naugachhia sub-division are expected to take the blow, sources from the Water Resources Department told The Hindu.“The Ganga has gone beyond the danger level for the first time in a decade. The situation is grim in areas like Naugachhia,” Water Resource Minister Vijay Chaudhary said. Flood-fighting work was being executed on a war footing, Mr. Chaudhary added.The Bhagalpur district administration had meanwhile urgently pressed a fleet of 100 boats into service.While the District Magistrate and the Chief Engineer are supervising operations near the spot, transportation of relief material is proving to be a difficult task owing to incessant rains in the area.In North Bihar, the river troika of the Kosi, the Bagmati and the Burhi-Gandak has exceeded their danger-mark in the districts of Supaul, Sitamarhi, Khagaria and Katihar."" August 19, 2011: ""Patna, Aug 19 (IANS) Five teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in five flood-hit districts of Bihar for rescue and relief operations, officials said Friday.The teams have been placed in Supaul, Saharsa, Madhepura, Khagaria and Gopalganj districts.The move came in the wake of major rivers like Ganges, Kosi and Mahananda flowing above the danger mark at several places due to heavy rains in the state and catchment areas of Nepal for the last few days, an official said. Hundreds of villages in Bhagalpur, Munger, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur, Saharsa, Madhepura and Bagaha districts face threats due to the increased water levels.“Water has already entered dozens of villages. Rising water level in Kosi river is giving sleepless nights to people,” an official of the water resources department told IANS.He said the water levels of rivers have been rising to dangerous levels at several places. “It is a dangerous sign.” Reports suggests that hundreds of people have been asked to shift to safer areas by the authorities.The state government has asked engineers and district officials to keep a 24-hour vigil.According to the Central Water Commission, the water level in Ganges crossed the red mark at several places in Bhagalpur, Patna, Begusarai and Farakka. Similarly, the Kosi was flowing above the danger mark at Bausa, Baltara and Kursela, and Mahananda at Dhengraghat and Jhada.""..""DADELDHURA: Some 80 houses at Jogbudha and Shirsha VDCs in Dadeldhura district have been inundated after flood in the Mahakali triggered by incessant rainfall entered the village.According to the Area Police Office Jogbudha, police have been facing difficulty to rescue the troubled villagers due to the continuous downpour.

In An Giang Province, rising waters broke through four dykes in Cho Moi, Tan Thanh and Chau Phu early today and late yesterday, leaving more than 2,720 ha of rice under water. Vo Thanh Phu, chairman of the Chau Phu District People's Committee, said the district had nearly 1,300 ha of rice inundated. In addition, more than 400km of dykes in the district were threatened by floods, he said. Huynh The Nang, deputy chairman of the An Giang People's Committee, said 4,000 ha of rice were inundated in An Giang so far. The Tien and Hau rivers, the two main tributaries of the Mekong, have been rising fast in recent days due to high tides and floods in the upper Mekong.In An Giang Province, the Tien rose to 4.75 metres, 0.25 meter above the third warning level at the Tan Chau Station on Wednesday, while the Hau rose to 4.11 metres, 0.1 metre above the third warning level at Chau Doc Station. In Dong Thap Province, a 30-meter section of the Ca Mui dyke in Tan Hong District's Tan Thanh A Commune was breached on Wednesday, flooding more than 520 ha of rice. Tan Hong People's Committee mobilised thousands of peoples and facilities to reinforce the dyke, but surging floodwaters still overwhelmed the dyke due to its weak foundations. Five other important dykes in Tan Hong that protect more than 3,500 ha of rice are threatened by the floods, according to the district People's Committee. As of Wednesday, more than 1,090 hectares of rice in Kien Giang Province were inundated, with nearly 400 ha destroyed. Kien Giang Province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has provided support of VND9 billion to farmers in Giong Rieng, Tan Hiep, Chau Thanh and Go Quao districts to pump water out of their rice fields. Floods have also eroded several dykes and inundated 815 ha of fruit and other crops in Vinh Long Province's Binh Tan District."" August 19, 2011: ""Kampong Cham. As the floodwaters recede, many living near the Mekong River are returning to their normal lives, even if they know high waters will come againEvacuees are returning to their homes, motorbikes are braving muddy roads and children splash around in what remains of the water, which only days ago inundated homes, roads and cropsBut for others, the flooding has taken human and material tolls that will not disappear as easily as the deluge – which has killed at least nine people and which experts have called the worst flooding in a decade for this early in the wet season. The burden of such losses weighs heavily on the families of Moha Khnhoung commune, in Kampong Cham’s Koh Sotin districtOne of the victims was two-year-old Phoung Sambath, the only child of a horse-cart driver living in Khpob village. Phoung Nam lost his son on Sunday after he drowned in the floodwaters near the steps of their home. Phoung Nam spoke to the Post on Wednesday, surrounded by neighbours and relatives in a friend’s home that could only be reached by wading through waist-deep water.“I miss my son. I keep imagining past times I spent with him,” said the 31-year-old father, whose wife left the family in April to move to Phnom Penh. “I lived with my son and now I am alone … I do not know what the future holds for me,” Phoung Nam said.“When he found out, he cried, he hit the ground, he hugged his son’s body,” relatives of the man told reporters.A modest funeral was held for the child on the same day he died.  Phoung Nam could not afford any new clothing for the child to be buried in, but neighbours pitched in.  Others in the village, which sits on the banks of the Mekong River, suffered property damage and crop loss in the floods which hit the area on Friday and only began to subside on Tuesday.By Wednesday, many of the houses in the village were still surrounded by about a foot of water and some of the roads were impassable. Rice paddies turned to impromptu fishing grounds, as farmers cast their nets into the chest-high water. The Mekong coursed by, high above its banks thanks to heavy rains in Laos and Thailand, forcing the commuter ferry to dock just shy of the village’s main thoroughfare, where residents were counting the cost of the damage. Villager Mao Lalin, 31, may have been lucky compared to some neighbours: the flooding spared his home. But it destroyed the morning glory he grew in the backyard for sale in his village.“I have lost more than a fifth of my income because of the flooding,” he said.“Within the last few years the flooding has never been as bad this,” said village chief Peang Nhen, 61, adding that the boy was the first person to be killed in the village by flooding since 1993. High river water, which inundated around five hectares of rice in the village, also came unseasonably early this year. “It usually doesn’t begin until September,” Pheang Nhen explained. “If the rice fields are destroyed, we will have to replant.”Communities across Kampong Cham province are picking up the pieces left by the receding floodwaters. About 25 kilometers away, in the Chirou I commune of Tbong Khmum district, flooding forced the evacuation of 69 families from Prek Toch village alone, said village chief Ly Sarith. Tolas Mab, a 70-year-old resident, said he had been forced to stay with relatives for six days after his home was inundated with floodwaters. “Villagers who own cattle have evacuated to a safer place … and some others are living in their boats,” he said, adding that the flooding had caused corn, potato, and cassava plantations in the village to rot.    Villager Hot Soem took his three cows and swam 500 metres to higher ground when the water was at its worst.“Cows can swim so they survived, but 20 of my chickens died,” he said.  “I could not save them in time.”The 58-year-old farmer spent five days away from home taking care of the cattle.  The rest of his family stayed on in their flooded home to protect their property from theft. “I am very concerned about their safety because they are not good at swimming,” Hot Soem said. “Now we are also confronting a food shortage.”The government and NGOs have cooperated to provide “quick, effective, and relatively organised” support for the thousands of people affected by the flooding, Oxfam spokesperson Francis Perez said on Monday. By Monday, the Cambodian Red Cross delivered 16 tonnes of rice, along with mosquito nets, blankets and other food supplies to villagers in affected areas.   The crisis is abating, at least for now. Mao Hak, deputy general director of the technical department at the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, said yesterday that water levels were stable in Kratie province, and receding in both Stung Treng and Kampong Cham.Still, some villagers continue to take precautions. Num Srey Teang, 28, lives next door to Phoung Nam and was one of a handful of people in attendance at his son’s funeral. Three years ago, she bought her two small children a pair of bright orange lifejackets which they clip on whenever the water from the Mekong spills into the village. “I don’t always have time to look after them,” she said. “This area gets flooded every year. August 11, 2011: ""AT least 100 families and about 1,700 cattle have been evacuated to higher ground after flooding from the Mekong Riverinundated areas of Stung Treng and Kratie provinces yesterday.Loy Sophat, Stung Treng provincial governor, said yesterday that rice fields and villages had been flooded in Siem Bok and Sesan districts.“About 100 families have been evacuated to safety and we are providing them with food and medicine,” he said.“The flooding has not yet risen to an alarming level, but the fact that it continues to rain in our province has people worried about their rice fields and crop plantations,” he added.Kratie provincial governor Kham Phoeun reported that a total of 30 communes were flooded in Kratie, Chhlong, Chet Borei and Sambor districts, inundating about 1,000 hectares of transplanted rice seedlings and affecting an estimated 1,000 families.  “We have evacuated more than 1,700 cows and buffaloes, but have not started evacuating people yet,” he said.Yesterday, Minister of Water Resources Lim Keanhor issued the third statement this week warning those who live along the Mekong to take precautions against flooding caused by heavy rains over the upper Mekong River in Laos and Thailand.

Residents jostled with police on Monday and Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered that the gate be opened by a meter (three feet).But city authorities warned that the flow through the gate could move via a major canal into large parts of the city which are now dry.""We are opposed to it but the government has ordered the BMA to open the gate, so more water will come,"" said Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) spokesman Jate Sopitpongstorn.""It could reach the Bang Chan industrial estate. We have to see the consequences,"" he told Reuters, adding that residents of the area had been told to be on alert.Yingluck's government and the Bangkok authority represent opposing factions in Thailand's strife-plagued politics.An expert from the government flood management team played down the danger to inner Bangkok of opening the sluice gate, saying the flow was relatively small compared with the amount coming in through leaks in the city's dikes.""Inner Bangkok is not so much an issue,"" said academic Anon Sanitiwong Na Ayutthaya. ""At least we know what to do, it's just a matter of time to fix the leaks.""The disaster has been the first big test for the government of Yingluck, the younger sister of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.Yingluck, a political novice, took over this year after an election that many Thais hoped would heal divisions that triggered street violence last year.Saving central Bangkok from a ruinous flood would be an important victory. The city's 12 million people account for 41 percent of Thailand's gross domestic product.But prolonged misery in outlying areas and heavily flooded provinces to the north would take the gloss off any victory for Yingluck, especially given a perception that those areas have been sacrificed to save the capital.To the north of Bangkok, Pathum Thani and Ayutthaya provinces have been largely inundated for weeks, along with seven industrial estates that have sprung up over the last two decades on what used to be the central plain's rice fields.""BE PREPARED""People eked out a living in the flooded provinces on Tuesday with women cooking over gas stoves in the shade of plastic sheets strung up over pick-up trucks while men in their underwear cast fishing nets into water covering roads. Cars, trucks and taxis were bumper to bumper for about 20 km (12 miles) on an elevated road out of Bangkok, parked and abandoned safely above the murky tide. The cabinet met to work out a recovery plan that one cabinet minister said this week could cost up to $30 billion, including an overhaul of the water-management system and rehabilitation of industrial estates. Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Kittirat Na Ranong said the government would need to borrow ""hundreds of billions of baht"" to recover and prevent a repeat of disaster during the annual rainy season. ""Any investor, ambassador, I talk to, they never ask how high the floodwaters are but what will Thailand actually do to prevent this from happening again,"" Kittirat told reporters. The government would invite experts from inside and outside the country to help draw up the plan and he would approach the Asian Development Bank to discuss financing. ""We have to be prepared for the future,"" Kittirat said. ""Preparation and the prevention of floods and drought is something we must start to do now."" Yingluck said on Monday she had assured Japanese investors there would be no repeat of the disaster. The government expects it will take three months to get the flooded industrial estates back on their feet. Thailand is the second-largest exporter of computer hard drives and global prices are rising because of a flood-related shortage of major components used in personal computers. Thailand is also Southeast Asia's main auto-parts maker and Japan's Honda Motor Co said car production could be difficult in the second half of its business year ending in March. Its Ayutthaya plant has suspended work indefinitely. The Bank of Thailand has nearly halved its projection of economic growth this year to 2.6 percent from July's 4.1 percent estimate, and said the economy -- Southeast Asia's second largest -- would shrink by 1.9 percent in the December quarter from the previous three months due to the floods. Headline inflation rose to 4.19 percent in October from 4.03 percent the previous month as the flooding pushed up some prices but the central bank said the rises were temporary and it would focus on longer-term factors in setting policy. The floods submerged four million acres (1.6 million ha), an area roughly the size of Kuwait, and destroyed 25 percent of the main rice crop in the world's largest rice exporter. The deluge was caused in part by unusually heavy monsoon rain but the weather has been mostly clear for the past week. The BMA said 2,245 mm (more than seven feet) of rain had fallen this year to the end of October, 40.8 percent above average.

Flood levels of 30-40 centimetres were reported at one location in the city.The National Disaster Warning Centre warned that nine canals in the capital, already near capacity levels, were likely to break their banks, while 13 districts and eastern zones outside flood barriers were likely to be flooded.High tides beginning this week could exacerbate the flooding, with fears that the Chao Phraya River, which runs through central Bangkok, will break its banks. Authorities are installing up to 400 water pumps along the river and digging canals to divert flood waters.Over the weekend, there were chaotic scenes and frantic evacuations in the ancient city of Ayutthaya, 80 kilometres upriver from Bangkok. The inner city island, where historical sites are located, was inundated after the water broke through the flood walls in many areas. Among those evacuated were some 2,000 patients from the provincial hospital.Residents and rescuers waded through waist- and chest-high water, hopping on trucks and boats, and moving to higher ground with whatever few belongings they could extricate. Journalist Simon Roughneen, reporting from Ayutthaya, wrote: “All day, groups of people have been clambering onboard dinghies, rafts and impromptu vessels cobbled together from truck tyre tubes, styrofoam boards—anything at all that floats.“Back outside the city’s hospital, Thai Red Cross volunteer Pipath Cheangnoi says he was asked by government officials to help co-ordinate the evacuation of more than 2,000 patients trapped inside the building—an effort that was ongoing as darkness fell amid dangerous conditions with electricity down or unusable, and strong currents swirling in places around the hospital gates.”Roughneen spoke to one relieved mother whose 5-year-old daughter had just been saved by rescuers who pushed through chest-high water to reach her after she was trapped upstairs by an overnight rush of water. “I was scared, worried. I still am, but thanks to these helpers I have my Sililak safe,” Thanarat ‘Yui’ Panomai said.The government has discussed possible evacuation measures for Bangkok, but with flood waters bearing down on the city of over 12 million, it is a case of too little, too late. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra told the media: “We are rushing to drain water and evacuate people before the seawater peaks. We don’t know how much rain will fall when the new storms arrive. We can’t protect every area.”The floods have also destroyed infrastructure, and paralysed economic life in parts of the country. More than 200 roads have been damaged, including the Asian highway, the main route to northern Thailand. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for this year has been scaled down from 4.4 percent to 3.6 percent as a result.Almost 200 factories, including a Honda plant and electronics and car parts facilities, were closed in Ayutthaya, after the Rojana industrial park was inundated. “It’s a crisis there now,” Industry Minister Wannarat Charnnukul told Bloomberg.com on Saturday. “There is nothing we can do because the water level is higher than the barriers.”There are fears that the floods, which extend across South East Asia, will further drive up food prices. The Thai farm ministry announced last week that the main rice harvest would be down 12 percent, with over 3 million tonnes possibly damaged by the floods. Thailand is the world’s biggest rice exporter, accounting for around 30 percent of exports.The floods threaten a political crisis for the Puea Thai-led coalition government, which was elected in July following a populist campaign that fraudulently appealed to the aspirations of the rural and urban poor.In a nationally televised address on October 7, Prime Minister Yingluck said: “We have to admit that this is more serious than in the past… The government is just a little more than a month old and it is difficult to cope with the situation because the volume of water is so high.” Earlier, Yingluck commented that the government was at its “wits end” because of the flooding.Since taking office, the government has been under pressure from business circles in Thailand and internationally to drop its election promises. Business associations are using the floods to demand that the government drop its pledge to raise the minimum wage. Employer representative Atthayuth Leeyavanija, a member of Thailand’s central wage-setting committee, warned against implementing a promised pay rise, saying: “Raising wages to 300 baht a day nationwide would have a severe impact on businesses.”Whilst the floods are a natural phenomenon, their devastating impact has been exacerbated by long-term government policies that have subordinated public safety to the profits of loggers and property developers.National Disaster Warning Centre director Captain Somsak Khaosuwan has publicly stated that the severity of the floods was a product of poor logistics and rampant deforestation. The Bangkok Post quoted him saying: “It used to be villagers had four to five days to prepare, but nowadays flooding can hit the same day as the warning… There are no forests to absorb the water.”Somsak said natural water reservoirs that prevented flooding in the past no longer existed due to building and property development: “The way we build our roads and urban areas, we don’t consider the natural flow of water. Often we build things directly in its path. Many villages are built right in the path of the water.” He added: “There are people who believed that their villages would not be flooded because they have never been flooded from the days of their parents and grandparents… But things have changed.”The flood crisis has exacerbated social tensions, with the Bangkok Post reporting violent clashes between residents in wet areas, angry at those living in dry areas. There was a confrontation between farmers and villagers in Ayutthaya province last Friday, with both sides firing shots into the air.Other countries in the region have also been affected by monsoonal rain and tropical storms. More than 170 people have been killed by flooding in Cambodia since early August. Some 230,000 families have been affected by the floods, and another 23,000 evacuated.At least 15 people, including nine children, have died in flooding since late September in Vietnam’s central and southern provinces. Dozens of houses had been swept away in the Mekong Delta and 27,700 more were under water, according to the state-run VnExpress.Two weeks ago, the Philippines were struck by Nalgae and Nesat, which claimed more than 100 lives.Flooding in Henan, Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces in China late last month affected some 12.3 million people, killing 17 people, and destroying more than 120,000 houses. The flooding in Shaanxi was reported to be the worst in 50 years."" October 2, 2011: ""Over 200 houses in Thailand's northern Lampang's Ko Kah district were submerged under flood waters early Sunday morning after heavy rains going on generating water runoff from a nearby hill.Heavy rains starting from around 2.00 a.m. on Sunday morning continued for hours causing high-level flood waters that inundated four villages, a home to over 200 households. Residents in flood- hit areas rushed to evacuate to higher grounds, a Ko Kah chief district officer said.In a related development, the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department announced on Sunday that the death toll from the nationwide flooding which had begun since July 25 now stood at 206.The department said a total of 150 districts in 23 provinces in northern, central, eastern and western regions are still under flood waters, affecting more than 1.8 million people"".

Police found the latest victim in Phichit's Taphan Hin district at 6am yesterday. Weerapat Sukkhum, 22, apparently drowned in the floodwater. Dr Surasen Thangthong, who heads Phichit's Primary Education Service Area 1 Office, said 20 schools under his jurisdiction were closed indefinitely in the wake of severe flooding. ""It's not possible for children to go to the heavily flooded schools,"" he said. In Phichit's Primary Education Service Area 2, 27 schools suspended classes indefinitely. According to Phichit's chief of disaster prevention and mitigation, Sanlek Kamjai, floods have affected more than 100,000 people in the province. Up to 70 per cent of the province's farmland - or about 140,000 rai - have been damaged.""Floods have raged on for about three weeks already,"" Sanlek said. ""Judging by the current situation, it will likely take at least one month for the floodwater to completely subside.""In Phitsanulok, floods have damaged 321,001 rai of farmland and affected 77,242 people. Three deaths have been reported, and the Public Health Ministry has found that up to 29 flood victims in Phitsanulok had become suicidal. DPMD deputy director-general Chatpong Chatphut said flooding had likely ravaged more than 3.37 million rai of farmland.""Up to 394,327 people are now flood victims,"" he said.The House of Representatives yesterday voted to set up an ad-hoc committee on flood prevention and solutions. The committee was tasked with studying how to prevent flooding and drought.It was expected to complete the study within 60 days.As run-off water from upriver provinces is now flowing down the Chao Phraya River, downstream provinces such as Angthong and Pathum Thani have started feeling the effects. In Anthong, some corners in Mueang and Pa Moke districts were inundated. In Pathum Thani's Sam Khok district, the Bang Toei Market was under 20cm of water yesterday. Deputy Interior Minister Choochart Harnsawas yesterday held a meeting with Pathum Thani MPs and provincial Governor Pirasak Hinmuangkao to draw up flood-prevention plans.The Royal Irrigation Department, meanwhile, said people living on the banks of the Chao Phraya River below the Chao Phraya Dam should start building embankments made of sandbags.""

Yingluck, who took office August 5, led a disaster-assessment team to the Bang Rakam and Phrom Phiram districts in the northern province of Phitsanulok. She was accompanied by Public Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri, who said free medical services were being provided by more than 300 mobile teams of doctors. He said more than 50,000 people had been affected by water-borne diseases due to the floods. About 50 deaths have been attributed to the monsoon flooding in Phitsanulok and 15 other provinces declared flood disaster zones. Train service has been disrupted since Saturday in northern Thailand due to the flooding. The prime minister was scheduled to visit flood-affected regions of Udon Thani province later on Sunday.

The Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department said the situation remained critical in seven provinces, according to the Post.Water has also flowed to downstream provinces in the Central Plains, inundating wide areas in four other places where water levels continued to rise, the Post said.The Nation said at least 16 provinces remain flooded.The floods followed days of heavy seasonal rain, causing rivers to burst their banks.""August 9, 2011: ""The Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department (DPMD) yesterday said flooding triggered by Tropical Storm NockTen, which has killed 20 people and left one person missing, is continuing to ravage 51 districts in Phrae, Sukhothai, Uttaradit, Phichit, Phitsanulok, Tak, Nakhon Sawan and Ayutthaya provinces, while affecting some 221,000 people.DPMD chief Wibul Sanguanpong reported that Tropical Storm NockTen had caused floods in 6,809 villages, located in 155 districts in 21 provinces, affecting 1,139,990 people and damaging 619,723 rai of farmlands. He added that the department has instructed provincial offices and agencies to urgently provide food, water and other aid to flood victims, and to deliver machines, flat boats, and drinking water to the region. Officials will also be dispatched to assess damage and provide assistance, in keeping with the Finance Ministry's regulations.In Uttaradit's Pichai district, the overflowing Yom River damaged some 40,000 rai of rice fields that were nearing harvest in tambon Tha Mafeuang. About 70 homes were submerged under two metres of water in Ban Thung Sanguan. The tambon has reportedly never flooded before, and the recent flooding was said to have been caused by the diversion of 2,500 cubic metres per second of water from Yom River to Nan River through Khlong Nam Lai to alleviate flooding in Phrae and Sukhothai. Uttaradit Governor Yothin Samutkhiri initially sent officials and 100 relief bags to aid the victims. The damage to Pichai district's farmland has been estimated at Bt22 million. A 59yearold farmer, On Yaemsuan, tearfully said her 35 rai of rice fields were completely damaged, while she had a September deadline to repay a Bt200,000 loan to grow rice from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives. She lamented that while she had invested Bt6,800 per rai, the government would only be offering compensation of Bt606 per rai for damage from the floods. She urged new Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and the four Pheu Thai MPs from Uttaradit to help the farmers.In Amnat Charoen, the previous night of heavy rainfall and runoffs from Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan caused the Mekong River to rise yesterday, prompting provincial governor Kaenpetch Chuangrangsi to alert Chanuman district officials to measure river levels and prepare for possible floods.""",1,0,3850,2,84,34,3325,957,News

Nearly 7,000 people were left at least temporarily homeless by flooding and 56 communities remained cut off by road or bridge collapses, with some rivers still swelling from as much as a foot of rainIn Haiti, one body was found in ravine near the southern coastal city of Les Cayes, but the cause of death had not yet been determined. There were only scattered reports of flooded homes and villages, downed trees and light damage to crops on the southern peninsula, which had been closest to Emily’s core. Alta Jean Baptiste, Haiti’s civil protection director, said the nation had largely escaped Emily’s wrath. After a series of catastrophic floods and mud slides that killed thousands in previous storms, he said residents are paying close heed to warnings and cooperating with evacuation orders. “The population is understanding more and more the necessity of protecting themselves, before the damages occur,” he said.But fortune also again smiled on Haiti. Just like with Hurricane Tomas last November, the capital city of Port-au-Prince, crowded with some 600,000 people still living in tents 18 months after a devastating earthquake, suffered little damage or flooding.The National Hurricane Center gave the remnants of Emily a good change of reforming sometime this weekend but, aside from potentially heavy rain and strong gusts in the northeastern Bahamas, forecasters did NOT expect the system to pose a significant threat. The system, whether it reorganizes or not, was forecast to move north and eventually curve into the open Atlantic Ocean.Even after it broke apart, Emily swept much of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico with torrential downpours.There were no rainfall reports from Hispaniola but Krizia Negron, a meteorologist in the San Juan office of the National Weather Service, said three to six inches fell across Puerto Rico, with up to 10 inches in spots. More rain likely fell across the Dominican Republic, which caught Emily’s strongest bands, she said.Flooding in rural areas claimed three people there, the newspaper Listín Diario reported.Two people drowned in Higüey, Altagracia province, when they were swept by the Duey River’s current, the newspaper said. Another man drowned in Santo Domingo East while swimming in a drainage ditch.The Emergency Management Center reported 21 provinces remaining on “red alert’’ for flooding. Local television reports showed extensive flooding in rural communities, where plantain farms were under water and many people live precariously near rivers or dams.At a press conference late Thursday, center director Juan Manuel Méndez called damage “extensive.’’“We ask people not to let their guards down, because precipitation will continue, and the grounds are saturated, especially in the south-southwest part of the country. The rain is what does most damage, not the wind.”In Haiti, damage reports were light.Emmanuelle Schneider, spokeswoman for the United Nations’ Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said 235 people were evacuated in Jacmel and Tabarre, as well as 65 prisoners from Gonaïves and Miragoane prison. In the Artibonite region, 300 people were evacuated by civil protection teams. Artibonite is an area particularly vulnerable to mass flooding. In 2004, back-to-back tropical storms left some 3,000 people dead in and around the city of around Gonaïves in central Haiti.""",1,Haiti,3848,1.5,82,33,3323,956,News

The heavy rain affected Lagos, Ogun and Oyo states.Residents of Benin City, Edo State are no strangers to flooding as it is commonplace that heavy rainfall comes with flood. Flood also affected some parts of Taraba State. Flood is our own tsunami or hurricane, though could have been managed without any problem.Flood has only reminded us that the government, be it in Lagos, Ogun or elsewhere, is not addressing the root of our under-development. The recent flood has taught us that sustainable development goes beyond constructing just few roads, bridges and planting flowers on few major roads and go to sleep. In fact, Lagos, like other parts of the country, is moving at a reverse speed. My heart goes out to those who lost their loved ones and also those who lost properties.Different reasons have been adduced to the cause of the damage while some have ignorantly stated that what happened was natural and could not have been otherwise. Governor Babatunde Fashola's response to the flooding is the usual martial order. Fashola had stated that some identified buildings on drainages and refuse dumping in drainages were responsible for the flooding and as such they will be demolished. On the surface, it may look reasonable because there are some houses built on drainages while many have been filled with refuse.However, these reasons are not the root cause of flood, they are just consequences of lack of planning. Where was the same government when these houses were erected on drainages? No one should lose sight of the fact that the flood also affected highbrow areas like Lekki, Victoria Island and Ikoyi.Besides, many of the drainages and canals were not properly built and have overtime degenerated to the extent that they could not properly serve their purposes; most of the canals have been silted and overgrown with plants; drainages have been filled with refuse and sand. Simply, flood could be caused by heavy rainfall that can force the river or ocean to over flow its banks. The recent flood in Lagos was not as a result of overflow of the Atlantic Ocean but by a heavy downpour with inadequate or poor drainage system.Lagos, just like Ibadan and Port Harcourt, is densely populated. The more population increases, the more the challenges of basic infrastructures. Lagos, like other parts of Nigeria, was never planned in a holistic manner. Planning means every area of life is put into consideration when putting and expanding basic infrastructures.When houses were built without putting into consideration a central water system, a central sewage, electricity, drainages, canals, roads, bridges, pipelines, rail lines, dams etc, there is bound to be a problem. In the last 30 years, new areas have been developed in Lagos with no corresponding basic infrastructures, like drainages, roads, canals, etc.Until we recognise that each house or drainage in one street is part of a whole community/city/town there is bound to be disaster. The level of physical development today is largely as a result of self-help or private investment. For example, Mr. A builds his house without considering the environmental impact in terms of what is best for the locality and to others in the community. He is in a race to create a blind alley such as others.A planned society takes into account effective channels of waste water from a building to drainage linking possibly to bigger drainage or floodways and to a canal or dam. And all the drainages, canals, roads etc, must be built to live up to the challenges of a low, high land and the environment in its entirety. When a country leaves everybody to build his or her house, possibly drainages and roads, it is encouraging a state of anarchy!"" July 19, 2011: ""Katsina — In Katsina state 13 people, mostly children and aged women, have been confirmed dead, while several others were injured following a flood disaster that wrecked havoc in various areas within the state metropolis. According to the state Government assessment committee, three persons including two women sustained fractures, while three others sustained various degrees of injuries as a result of the disaster.Speaking to Weekly Trust on the preliminary investigation of the committee, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works and Housing, Alhaji Danjuma Abdullahi Alti said all the injured persons have been treated free of charge at Government owned hospitals.Weekly Trust investigation revealed that while some of the deceased drowned in a big culvert that passed through various communities within the state metropolis, others were killed by collapsed buildings.Mallam Abdullahi Aliyu an elder in Kofar-Marusa said that ""one of the deceased, Abdullahi Shitu, a JSS 3 student of Government College, Katsina fell into a culvert while trying to rescue a woman who was shouting for help to rescue her two kids.""Late Abdullahi and Al-Amin Rufa'I, a primary four pupil, Weekly Trust gathered were pushed by water to a neighboring quarters called Tudun-Katsira where their corpses was found a day after the disaster.Weekly Trust gathered that over 340 houses have been affected by the flood, while 120 houses completely collapsed and properties worth millions of naira were destroyed. When our correspondent visited the affected areas he observed that the areas were congested and have no drainages for easy passage of water. Quarters such as Kofar-Marusa, 'Yan-Taba, Masanawa, Gafai, Baking, Makuda and Kofar-Yan Daka were in need of roads and drainages to save the residents from the menace of flooding. And even where drainages exist, they were blocked by garbage as the communities are in the habit of dumping their wastes inside them. Weekly Trust also observed that most of the structures affected were constructed on waterways.""""Sokoto — The Sokoto Rima River Basin Authority recently called on people living downstream Goronyo dam to vacate the areas to avoid being caught in another flood disaster.The villages affected include Kagara Rima, Balla, Boye Kai, Sabon/Tsohon Gari, DanWuru, Dolle and Gidan Magajiya.But some of the residents of these villages insist they would not move.

It was only last week that they gave us N9, 000 but we have already finished repairing our houses, we would not relocate. The houses government said it was building for flood victims have not even reached one-third completion stage.""Calabar — Over 500 people have been displaced in Cross River State as a result of the heavy rainfall which lasted four days, while property worth over N100 million were destroyed.Director-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, Mr. Vincent Aquah, who confirmed this in Calabar, said the persistent rain caused socio-economic damage and destroyed more than 106 hectars of farmland.Aquah said over 40 houses in Calabar and its environs were flooded, leading to the displacement of about 500 people in various parts of the state.The SEMA boss said that based on the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NIMET, predictions for higher rainfall this year, more devastating rainstorms would occur, and may wreck more havoc.He, however, noted that the state government was doing everything possible to ameliorate the sufferings of those affected by the flood.Mr. Aquah said despite the challenges facing SEMA, especially in the area of mobility, the staff were determined to carry out rapid assessment and other intervention measures.He advised the people to urgently contact relevant authorities for rescue whenever there was serious flooding and to vacate such places to avoid loss of lives.

South Asia experiences monsoon rains from June to September, which are vital for its agriculture. But the rains frequently affect millions of people in countries like India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal - devastating crops, destroying homes and sparking outbreaks of diseases such as diarrhoea and dysentery.   Officials in India's northeast oil- and tea-rich state of Assam described the situation as ""alarming"".

Thousands of hectares of paddy crops are estimated to have been damaged.   Across the border in Nepal, officials said at least 73 people had been killed by landslides and floods, and another 25 were missing, since the start of the monsoon season last month. Around 750 people have been evacuated due to the threat of more landslides in Rukum district in the west of the Himalayan nation.

The worst affected villages are Kesukhona, Nepalisuti and Rotua.The situation in Dhemaji was compounded by breaching of a temporary mud dam for diverting water of the Subansiri built during construction of the Lower Subansiri Hydro Electric Power Project.The temporary dam regularly breaches during the rainy season when uprooted trees brought down by the Subansiri fromArunachal hit against it and demolish the bundh, sources added.

Most of the approximately 3,000 people living in low-lying areas of Pierre and Fort Pierre had left homes, and others loading their belongings onto pickup trucks said they’d be gone by Gov. Dennis Daugaard’s unofficial deadline of 8 p.m. No one was ordered to leave home ahead of Friday’s planned dam releases, but it appeared few were willing to take their chances. Curt Mortenson, 59, said he and his wife moved into a home they built upstream of Fort Pierre just eight months ago. He was born in 1952, the year of the last great flood to swamp the cities, which happened before the construction of dams to prevent future catastrophes. Water releases from the Oahe Dam were expected to increase slightly starting Friday morning and gradually rise until Tuesday, when water levels were projected to crest four feet higher, or about two feet below the levee top. Officials have kept the releases steady for nearly a week as people moved possessions to higher ground, placed sandbags around their homes and arranged for other places to live. A similar release schedule was planned starting Saturday at Gavin’s Point Dam upstream of Dakota Dunes, where the water level is expected to eventually rise another seven feet by June 14, again cresting about two feet below the tops of levees. Daugaard and other officials said emergency earthen levees being built to protect the threatened areas should be completed in time to stop the rising water, but the governor warned people not to assume the levees would hold. “While we hope the levees will provide protection for property, we urge that people not place themselves in danger or become complacent because a levee that is holding today is just holding today,” Daugaard said. Ed Stutesman of Pierre said it was a sad day Thursday as he finished moving things out of his house. “When you leave your own place, it’s a different life. Thirty-five years I’ve lived here.

But the cascade of water from the Morganza floodway is hampering the local oil industry and fishermen on the bayou.Meanwhile, what is believed to be the first death related to the flooding since the river's rising waters began affecting Mississippi and Louisiana was reported Thursday in Vicksburg, Miss.

""We certainly are discouraging people from getting near it and in it.""Shular said many people in kayaks were out in the main channel last night.

There are 11 million cultivated acres of crops in Mississippi and damaged crops will have an affect on prices nationwide,"" he said.Prosser said new plantings under water include corn, soybeans, and cotton with thousands of farmers who have yet to plant wondering when and where they could get a crop in.""We have to watch when the waters recede because that is when the real problems start,"" Prosser said.""I've never seen anything like this and I've been farming for 31 years. This is a once-in-a-lifetime flood,"" said Joe Christian, a 48-year-old second-generation farmer in Jonesboro, Arkansas, about 60 miles northwest of Memphis.The cresting river will be welcome news to the nine floating casinos in Tunica County, Mississippi, about 25 miles south of Memphis. They have been closed because of flooding since May 2, and the economic impact has been severe.Valerie Morris, vice-president for Caesars Entertainment in Tunica, said some of the casinos could open in as early as two weeks, while others could be closed for up to six more weeks.The casinos gross about $87 million a month, with $10 million going to state and local taxes. They also employ 9,700 people. ""This is unprecedented,"" Morris said. ""We're 24/7, so we have never closed.""The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the Bonnet Carre spillway north of New Orleans Monday to divert some water to Lake Pontchartrain. It had no impact on homes or businesses.The Corps also has asked permission to open the Morganza Spillway on Thursday, which would reduce pressure on Baton Rouge and New Orleans by diverting water to the Atchafalaya River Basin. This would force the evacuation of some people and livestock.Last week, the Corps blasted open a Missouri levee, flooding about 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland to ease pressure on the levee system and towns in southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Dozens of farms were flooded.Through Mississippi, residents were bracing for potential record crests at Vicksburg on May 19 and at Natchez on May 21 and authorities were warning that up to 5,000 Mississippi residents may be forced to evacuate.""",1,0,3809,2,43,17,3284,940,News

If it does, Mayor Shari Decter Hirst said 700 homes would be threatened by overland flooding.The state of emergency gives the civic government the right to go onto private property without permission, and do whatever work is necessary to mitigate the effects of flooding. It was required to allow city workers to drain the rising pond into nearby bushland.Meanwhile, officials in Radville, Sask., have declared an emergency after floodwaters rose and threatened homes in one area of the town, plus its water pumping station.Mayor Shirley Cancade said Long Creek began rising over the weekend, then surged Monday evening, approaching several homes in the community about 130 kilometres south of Regina.""We've manage to save one, but another was affected quite dramatically,"" she said late Tuesday afternoon.

In recent weeks close to 4,000 people have been evacuated to 17 camps situated on higher ground in the Caprivi Region, Namibia's poorest area.The narrow strip of land, barely 30 kilometres wide borders Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

""The rainy season is supposed to last several more weeks, so it is possible that it rains again upstream in Zambia. In that case we can expect more flooding, but at least we will know it weeks in advance,"" said Van Langenhove.Local authorities have devised an early warning system that is one of the best functioning in the region. The system relies on informal communication of water levels from country to country by email or telephone.""We have definitely seen an improvement in the speed with which disaster management teams respond. Earlier we would have to mobilise helicopters to airlift people and there was no provision for camps,"" says Van Langenhove.""Because we now can give a warning three weeks before the flood arrives, evacuation points are being prepared on time.

A huge band of monsoon rain hanging over a coastal area south of Cairns prompted flash flood warnings from the Bureau of Meteorology in Queensland state, which was battered by months of deadly flooding that began late last year and by a giant cyclone in February. In the hard-hit town of Cardwell - where Cyclone Yasi tore roofs off houses, threw boats from the sea and shredded the main road last month - nearly 200mm of rain fell in just 24 hours, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said. Officials set up an evacuation centre and a State Emergency Service team was attempting to push through flooded roads to reach the community on Wednesday. “Those people, particularly in Cardwell, still reeling from Cyclone Yasi must be thinking what on earth is next,” Bligh told reporters in Brisbane. “The thoughts of all Queenslanders are with them.” Yasi came on top of Australia's worst flooding in decades, with 35 000 homes destroyed, 35 people killed and Brisbane, the country's third-largest city, inundated. This week's floods have killed one person. A 42-year-old woman died after her car was swept from a flooded road in Kuranda, north of Cairns. Her body was found on Tuesday, Queensland police said.

On closer inspection, the plants have a sickly yellowish hue and the heads of corn that should be ripening in time for the April harvest are nowhere to be seen. For most of the farmers in this remote, mountainous district, and in many other parts of Lesotho, there will be no harvest this season. Heavy rains which started in December and are expected to continue through much of February have washed away top soil and nutrients and left fields waterlogged and weed infested. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in some of the worst hit districts up to 60 percent of crops have been destroyed while nationally at least 4,700 livestock, mainly sheep and goats, have died. Lesotho’s mountainous topography and erratic weather mean it already produces only enough grain to meet about 30 percent of its needs. The country had increased its production of maize - the main cereal crop - and sorghum during 2010, but the heavy rains are likely to reverse those gains. “It’s going to affect food security in the worst way because Lesotho doesn’t produce enough food as it is,” Matsiliso Mmojaki, head of the national Disaster Management Authority (DMA), told IRIN. Out of a population of just over two million, Mmojaki estimated 250,000 will need food assistance in the coming months. Not a disaster? In the village of Phaila, in Thaba-Tseka District, Tsepo Phaila, 31, watched one afternoon in early January as a river of water swept down a hillside, tearing up the trees he and his family had planted for firewood, and flooding their maize field. By the time the water receded, only a few broken stalks poked up from the mud. It's going to affect food security in the worst way because Lesotho doesn't produce enough food as it is ""We can't plant there any more because the topsoil has washed away,"" Phaila said. The family has one other smaller field where maize plants are still standing but are too rain-damaged to produce a harvest. ""There's nothing we can do right now,"" said Phaila, explaining that the maize and the firewood provided the only source of income to support himself and nine other family members. Many other households in the village and across northern Lesotho are facing a similar predicament, but the government has yet to declare the situation a disaster. ""Should we say because the government hasn't declared it a disaster, it's not a disaster?"" asked Teboho Chalane, the Ministry of Agriculture's extension officer for Thaba-Tseka District. ""A lot of people have been affected; there will be no maize for them, so we need to do something to make sure they get something to eat."" He added that if seeds could be distributed quickly, there was still time for affected households to grow vegetables before the start of winter. In the longer term, said Chalane, communities needed to become less reliant on maize and start keeping livestock such as poultry and pigs that could be bred and sold. As for the fields of stunted maize plants, his advice to farmers was: ""Take a scythe and cut them all down."" Like many parts of Southern Africa, Lesotho had been warned to expect a heavier than usual rainy season due to the La Niña phenomenon, but Mmojaki of the DMA said ""the intensity [of the rains] was just beyond our imagination; it has never really happened here."" A rapid assessment of the damage conducted in January found that in addition to the extensive crop losses, a number of roads had been washed away making some health facilities unreachable. Stocks of essential medicines, including antiretrovirals (ARVs) and drugs to treat diarrhoea, an outbreak of which had spread across the country, were running low. The DMA has developed a contingency plan and submitted it to the government for approval. It includes urgent repairs to roads, bridges and water supply systems as well as assistance to farmers in the form of subsidies, seeds and fertilizers. The plan comes with a price tag of US$68.5 million, an amount that economic policy head in the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning Motena Ts'olo said the government would struggle to raise at a time when the global economic slowdown and reduced revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were already straining the national budget.

The South African government has declared disaster areas in eight of its nine provinces.And it’s not over yet. Above-average rainfall is forecast for South Africa and neighboring countries for the next few months.Much of southern Africa is now on flood alert, including Mozambique, where at least 13 people have died from floods and thousands have fled their homes for higher ground. Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia are also on alert for flooding.While this is the annual rainy season in southern Africa, the heavier than usual rainfall has been blamed on La Nina, the weather pattern behind the severe flooding in other southern hemisphere countries including Australia, Brazil and the Philippines.In South Africa, the government has put the flood damage at $211 million, but this is an early estimate and expected to rise. At least 13,000 homes have been damaged by the floods across the country, including thousands of shacks washed away, according to the National Disaster Management Center. Squatter communities known as “informal settlements” have been most affected as they are often built near rivers and in other low-lying areas.The South African government, criticized for being poorly prepared to deal with the heavy rains, announced Thursday that it had stepped up its humanitarian efforts, including increased coordination with local authorities, to help people affected by the floods and to ""minimize loss of lives"" in further flooding.Health authorities are on alert for outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne diseases in South Africa and throughout the region. There are also concerns that the torrential rains will trigger an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, a livestock disease that last year killed 26 people and 8,500 animals in South Africa.Floods have so far cost South African farmers $284 million, including damage to farm infrastructure and lost crops, said the farmers group Agri SA, but a full assessment can only be done once the water recedes. The crops most affected by the flooding are corn, sunflowers and grapes grown to make raisins.Agriculture Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson this week promised government assistance to farmers in the form of replacing infrastructure, seeds and fertilizer, but said there would be no financial compensation.She warned that the floods would result in rising food prices because of supplies being affected.Earlier this month, heavy rains delayed and derailed trains, disrupting exports of coal and corn, said South African logistics firm Transnet.Joe Gondo, president of the National African Farmers’ Union of South Africa, said that the system of dams on South Africa’s swollen rivers needs to be improved in the longterm. But for now, all farmers can do is brace for difficult months ahead, he said.“For now, when the rain comes, this is a God-made thing. You can’t stop the rain,” Gondo said.The South African Weather Service on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy rains expected for the next few days in Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West provinces. The country’s biggest dam, the Gariep, is 112 percent full and rising, and the Vaal Dam is at 100 percent capacity.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has appealed to the public to help with donations, saying that many provinces are running out of money to help those affected by the floods.“Without sounding alarmist, I would like to highlight the fact that we are in a race against time to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected,” Dlamini said in a media briefing.Most of the deaths have occurred in the coastal KwaZulu-Natal province, with 88 people recorded killed in the storms and floods, according to a report by Dlamini’s ministry. In the Eastern Cape province, widespread hail storms have damaged property, livestock and crops, and 21 people have died. Lightning strikes and tornados have also caused deaths and property damage.In nearby Mozambique, which has also been battered by torrential rains, the government has issued a “red alert” for potential floods in the country’s central and southern regions, putting disaster relief workers on standby.In 2000, Mozambique was devastated by widespread flooding that killed 800 people, destroyed infrastructure and caused massive losses to agricultural production.January 26, 2011: ""Flooding in South Africa has killed more than 100 people over the last month, saturating farms in the major food producer for the continent and leading the government to declare 33 municipalities disaster areas.The government at the weekend said the death toll from the flooding had more than doubled from its previous estimate to over 100 people, with most of the fatalities coming from the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province. ""Without sounding alarmist, I would like to highlight the fact that we are in a race against time to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected,"" Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said in a Web posting on Monday.Preliminary assessments show about 424,150 hectares of land have been affected but there has not been an estimate on the financi...

Vhembe was among the municipalities declared disaster areas by Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Sicelo Shiceka. Limpopo local government and housing spokeswoman Tseng Diale said the village had been cut off during flooding late last week. Locals had been unable to leave the area. Emergency services were able to get to the area by land to deliver supplies. Last week four people drowned and two were injured during the floods in the province. All of the province's five districts had been affected with more than 1500 dwellings damaged. The Vhembe district was the most affected with 632 damaged houses. Two people were injured in Modimolle and Lephalale, in the Waterberg district municipality. The four drowned in Sekhukhune.""

South Africa's Cooperative Governance Ministry said at least 40 people had been killed or gone missing in the flooding, and seven out of the country's nine provinces had been declared disaster zones.

Maputo — The Zambezi Valley Water Board (ARA-Zambeze) warned on Friday of likely flooding on the lower Zambezi following increased discharges from the Cahora Bassa dam.Large amounts of water have been flowing into the Cahora Bassa lake from Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the dam operating company, Hidroelectrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB), has announced that, in order to ensure the security of the dam, the amount of water discharged will, as from Saturday, rise from 3,200 to 4,400 cubic metres a second.According to the ARA-Zambeze alert, when this surge of water from the dam reaches the lower Zambezi it will cause localized flooding in Caia and Marromeu districts.The level of the river is expected to reach six metres in Caia and 5.8 metres in Marromeu - in each case this is a metre above flood alert level. Access roads between Marromeu town and surrounding villages are expected to be flooded.Further upstream, in Mutarara district, the Zambezi will also be above flood level, and is expected to isolate the locality of Inhangoma.Sustainable DevelopmentFaced with this forecast, the National Emergency Operational Centre is already warning people living near the banks of the Zambezi and its tributaries to move to higher ground. People are also advised not to make any attempt to cross swollen rivers. The warnings cover the entire Zambezi valley from Tete city to the Indian Ocean.Rivers in central and southern Mozambique are also on the rise.

Authorities have not given estimates on the number of missing people.Wemerly Moraes, 37, was waiting with his wife outside the morgue on Saturday morning to identify a body that could be the missing two-year-old son of his sister, whose body has already been buried.""This happened on Wednesday morning. When I went there on Thursday, there was still no-one working to find victims,"" the 37-year-old builder said. ""Maybe then he was still alive.""Up to half the victims of the disaster are feared to be children, charity Save the Children said.Gardener Odair da Silva told Globo television that he had to dig out the bodies of his father and stepmother from the wreckage of their home near Nova Friburgo town, where at least 247 people died. He left their corpses on the side of a road ""I asked firefighters for help but they aren't giving much priority to helping people,"" he said.The extent of the damage has posed a challenge for Brazil's new President Dilma Rousseff and exposed major flaws in emergency planning and disaster prevention in a country that aspires to attain developed-nation status in coming years.Rousseff visited the region on Thursday and pledged a swift relief effort that has yet to pan out in some of the hardest-hit areas, though anger has so far been mostly directed at state and local authorities. The federal government has earmarked 780 million reais in emergency aid and donations were starting to pour in from around the country.The torrent of earth and water swept like a tsunami through mostly poor communities, smashing houses and killing whole families as they slept. Some corpses in Teresopolis were found several kilometres away from their houses.Emergency teams are still struggling to reach some areas and have had to dig through the rubble with their hands because vehicles and heavy equipment could not get through. Steady rainfall is further hampering rescuers.Jorge Alfonso, a 42-year-old cook, said he lost 14 relatives when a mudslide virtually wiped out the village of Campo Grande, including his mother, two sisters, a brother and two adult sons. So far, only six of the bodies have been found.""I'm without words,"" said Alfonso, who has been moving back and forth between the cemetery to bury his relatives and the mortuary to identify them ever since the disaster struck.

At least 146 people have been killed in the town, 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Rio.Other officials said the disaster was the worst ever to befall the Serrana, a soaring, lush area that used to be a getaway for 19th-century Brazilian nobility and which is now a tourist spot, especially for Rio residents during the current southern hemisphere summer.In Nova Friburgo, 140 kilometers north of Rio, the number of victims rose to 155, while 34 were killed in Petropolis, according to GloboNews.At least three firemen were killed when they were engulfed in tons of mud as they tried to rescue victims.The death toll could rise in the coming hours, a spokesman for the Teresopolis municipality said. ""There are villages in the interior which we haven't yet reached,"" he said.Officials in Teresopolis said 2,200 people have either lost or had to abandon their homes.The full extent of the devastation remained unknown because communication and access to the stricken zone was complicated by the destruction of roads and bridges, while telephone service was cut in some areas.Authorities say they are particularly concerned over the fate of residents in the Campo Grande area of Teresopolis, where Civil Defence teams estimate 2,000 houses have been destroyed and 150 people buried, according to the G1 de Globo website. Rescue teams were expected to arrive later Thursday.The calamity was the first natural disaster facing Brazil's new president, Dilma Rousseff, who took power less than two weeks ago. She was scheduled to fly over the disaster zone in a helicopter later.At least as much rainwater as the region usually sees in two or three weeks hit the Serrana before dawn on Wednesday, as residents were sleeping in their homes.The downpour triggered mudslides and caused rivers to burst their banks, carrying away cars, homes and people.Meteorologists blamed the extraordinary precipitation on a cold front that intensified the already heavy wet season southeastern Brazil experiences every summer.That cold front moved through Sao Paulo early in the week before moving on to Rio de Janeiro state.More rain was forecast in the coming days.Rousseff's government has released 467 million dollars in emergency aid to help the rain-hit region.The health ministry announced it was also sending seven tonnes of medicine, including antibiotics, blood pressure remedies, masks and syringes -- enough to last 45,000 people for a month.The deadly downpour happened one year after mudslides killed more than 50 people in Angra dos Reis, another tourist area.At least 473 people were killed in Brazil last year as a result of heavy rains, according to the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.""January 9, 2011: ""RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian authorities say the number of people left homeless by flooding has risen to about 100,000 in four southeastern states.

Our entire town has been flooded since Friday with flood waters reaching as high as 12 feet. Some of my people are staying on top of their houses just to avoid being swept by the flood waters,” Monleon said.In Maslog, all its 12 villages have also been flooded brought about by days of non-stop rain, the town’s local operation officer, Kenneth Balase, said in a text message Saturday.Balase said the over 800 affected families took temporary shelter in a military camp and at a multi-purpose farmers’ training center, both located on higher ground at the town proper.Others chose to evacuate to hilly areas located just within the town center, he added.“Our transportation is paralyzed due to the high water… only the roofs of some of the houses could be seen. We need assistance from outside,” Balase said.Jipapad and Maslog are adjoining low-lying towns on Eastern Samar’s border with Northern Samar. The two towns are separated by a river from the provincial capital Borongan and could only be reached by boat, according to Monleon.In Jipapad, families have been abandoning their houses since Friday to find safer ground. And most of them are now staying at the town’s church and at the municipal hall, said Mayor Monleon.Both structures are located at an elevated portion of the town, according to Monleon.The mayor said water has entered the ground floor of her two-story house located on a slightly elevated area.But the mayor said her main concern has been to provide food assistance to the affected families.Around 1,967 families or 9,835 persons in Jipapad have been displaced due to the flooding, she said.Monleon said that their P500,000 calamity fund for the year has been consumed.The provincial government headed by Gov. Conrado Nicart has sent P200,000 as assistance, which she said the municipal government would use to buy relief goods for the displaced families.But even if Jipapad has gone under water, Monleon said not a single person has been reported missing or injured.January 3, 2011: ""More than 1,000 people were displaced Monday due to flashfloods triggered by heavy rains in the southern Philippines, rescuers said.Max Tutor, head of a rescue team, told a local radio station that over 1,000 people from low-lying villages in the township of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur province, have been evacuated to safer grounds early Monday due to flooding caused by a two-day downpour.In the nearby city of Surigao, over 300 people were affected by flashfloods, witnesses said, adding floodwaters submerged some villages there.Alilio Ensomo, an official of mining and geological department in the region, asked residents living near mountains and those engaged in small-scale mining activities to stay away from the mountainsides as these were prone to landslides.The local disaster control department is closely monitoring the situation and preparing for mass evacuation of the affected residents if the situation worsens.

Out front, two holiday reindeer were enveloped in mud several feet deep.Many California residents who endured flooding, mudslides and evacuations during a weeklong onslaught of rain must now clean up or even rebuild — and some face the prospect of not being able to spend Christmas at home.The storm's push across the West left a muddy mess Thursday across Southern California and the threat of avalanches in Nevada, where Clark County officials urged residents of Mount Charleston, near Las Vegas, to leave after snow slides near two mountain hamlets.Preliminary damage estimates throughout California were already in the tens of millions of dollars and expected to rise. A state of emergency was declared in a total of nine counties, including Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Barbara.The inland region of Southern California east of Los Angeles emerged as among the hardest hit, especially San Bernardino County.In Highland, people were literally chased from their homes by walls of mud and water, leaving behind dwellings strung with holiday lights. They returned Thursday to find their neighborhood inundated with mud. Five homes were destroyed and nearly 70 others damaged.Highland officials estimated the storm caused $17.2 million damage to homes, cars and a bridge that was washed away.Work crews tried to reopen more than a dozen canyon and mountain roads that were closed by slides and floods.

In Orange County, spokesman Howard Sutter issued a preliminary damage estimate of $23 million.Along the coast in the county, the upscale community of Laguna Beach suffered an estimated $4 million in damage to 46 businesses and 20 homes.A section of the city's popular beachfront park was washed away, leaving chunks of mud and a gaping open space where green grass had been the day before.Roads also remained a problem. Crews shut sections of Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles and Orange counties to remove loose rocks and clean up mudflow from hillsides. Further inland, rock and mudslides forced the closure of five state routes in Riverside and San Bernardino counties.The rain also washed trash, pesticides and bacteria into waterways, prompting health warnings. Four beaches were closed in Northern California's San Mateo County, and another 12 miles of beach from Laguna Beach to San Clemente in Orange County were off-limits because of sewer overflows.Curtis Duran, 45, and his two children strolled the trash-strewn beach in Long Beach and surveyed debris carried to the shoreline by the Los Angeles River.Cans, baseballs, plastic bottles and even a baby's high chair sat on the sand mixed with piles of discarded wood and shards of plastic. ""We come down here all the time, and I've never seen so much,"" Duran said.In the Central Valley agricultural region, Tulare County officials said farms and dairies had been hard hit by flooding. About 300 homes were damaged, and 25 roads remained closed.Allison Lambert, information officer for health and human services, said preliminary damage estimates ranged beyond $30 million.About 25 homes sustained damage in Kern County at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, while a highway through the Kern River canyon was expected to remain closed through the end of the year after ""truck-sized rocks"" were washed onto it, fire spokesman Sean Collins said.""

""We need to take more care of our environment and pay more attention to protecting our eco-systems.""Overnight rains dumped 44.5 centimetres (17.5 inches) of rain on the city, the biggest deluge since June 1992, when 49.7 centimetres fell in a day.""We are deploying troops to rescue people who have been marooned as well as to clear dozens of cars struck in flooded roads,"" said Colonel Dampath Ratnayake who was coordinating relief at the Colombo Operations Command.""The storm water system is unable to cope with the volume of water and we are also sending troops to help municipal workers clear some of the blocked drains,"" he said.Navy boats and airforce helicopters were deployed to help stranded residents and police said thousands of houses were under water.

In the country's capital, quake refugees resisted calls to abandon flimsy tarp and tent camps.Driving winds and storm surge battered Leogane, a seaside town west of Port-au-Prince that was near the epicenter of the Jan. 12 earthquake and was 90 percent destroyed. Dozens of families in one earthquake-refuge camp carried their belongings through thigh-high water to a taxi post on high ground, waiting out the rest of the storm under blankets and a sign that read ""Welcome to Leogane.""""We got flooded out and we're just waiting for the storm to pass. There's nothing we can do,"" said Johnny Joseph, a 20-year-old resident.The growing hurricane with 85 mph (140 kph) winds, was battering the western tip of Haiti's southern peninsula and the cities of Jeremie and Les Cayes.At least three people died trying to cross swollen rivers, Haiti civil protection officials said. The hurricane had earlier killed at least 14 people in the eastern Caribbean.The center of the storm was about 140 miles (230 kilometers) northwest of Port-au-Prince, draping charcoal clouds over the city. Steady rain turned the streets of the capital into flowing canals that carried garbage through the city. Farther north in Gonaives, a coastal city twice inundated by recent tropical storms, police evacuated more than 200 inmates from one prison to another.Aid workers are concerned the storm will worsen Haiti's cholera epidemic, which has killed more than 440 people and hospitalized more than 6,700 others.In Leogane, an earthquake camp suddenly became an island as floodwater surged around it, stranding hundreds of people in their tents.Closer to the shore, water poured into the Leogane home of Abdul Khafid, swirling around the furniture. His family grabbed its most important items - birth certificates, a radio and a computer - and headed to their mosque to spend the night.Haiti's civil protection department had urged people living in camps for the 1.3 million Haitians made homeless by the Jan. 12 earthquake to go to the homes of friends and family.But many ignored the advice, fearing their few possessions might be stolen or they might even be denied permission to return when the storm is over.Most of Haiti's post-quake homeless live under donated plastic tarps on open fields. Much is private land, where they have been constantly fighting eviction. A September report from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said 29 percent of 1,268 camps studied had been closed forcibly, meaning the often violent relocation of tens of thousands of people.U.S. Marines were standing by on the USS Iwo Jima off the coast of Haiti, preparing to help take relief supplies if needed.Late Thursday, Tomas passed to the east of Jamaica, where schools remained closed and public transportation was stalled on Friday as the island struggled with widespread flooding from a previous storm.Patrice Edmond, a maid who caught a ride into Kingston, said buses were not operating.""I barely got a drive to come over, but I'm a determined person,"" she said.Seventy-five miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the storm's eye at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in southeastern Cuba, the military suspended flights, canceled school and closed the harbor to recreational craft.",1,0,3742,1.5,150,49,3219,914,News

The worst floods in decades from an overflow of the River Chari have the government, NGOs and residents hammering out plans to avoid such disasters in future. Water is still rising from late September when the Chari burst its banks and swallowed up homes in riverbank communities. Residents and experts say similar overflows happened in 1988 and in 1998, but that this flooding is the worst. The government has said it plans to relocate riverbank communities. Some residents - still putting up sandbags and chunks of their broken homes to block the water - want solutions that will allow them to stay put. But that is not viable, Chad Communications Minister Kalzeubé Payimi Deubet told IRIN. ""Relocation is the soundest option. Otherwise these communities would see the same destruction again and again. It is a danger for all of N'djamena if we don't stabilize that area."" After the recent overflow, the water rose so that it began to reach higher parts of N'djamena via canals. ""You had a situation where experts observed the flow reversed - instead of water from the city feeding the river, the river started pushing into the city,"" UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative Marzio Babille told IRIN. In a 25 October visit to the neighbourhood of Walia in the south of the capital, President Idriss Deby said the government would set up a higher, dryer area where residents would relocate. ""These populations must abandon the riverbeds of the Chari and Logone rivers,"" Deby said. Logone also flows through the capital and into Lake Chad. Some residents are too attached to their land and prefer to stay, Ngolfou Pierre, head of a Walia neighbourhood flood-response committee, told IRIN. ""We will analyse different options for keeping people here, such as building dykes, and present these to the government. ""We appreciate the president coming here to see the situation first-hand, and his wanting to seek solutions. It was clear that he was moved by seeing this population living in water. We have to look at both options - staying or going. But such a decision must not be made based on emotion but on a solid analysis."" UNICEF is bringing in hydraulic engineers and floodgate specialists from Sweden, France and Egypt in the coming days, according to Babille. ""A sound, quick response to the emergency is preventing the spread of disease and saving lives,"" he told IRIN. ""But at the same time you must have solid mid- and long-term planning to manage the river, use pumping stations, construct effective drainage systems and provide proper sanitation."" An inter-agency (UN and NGOs) group is exploring medium- and long-term solutions for the communities bound to be hit repeatedly by flooding. It is calling for lasting solutions, ""because the rise of the Chari and the Logone is a cyclical phenomenon"", according to a report on a 22 October mission to the area. The group recommends the construction of canals and dykes to protect the riverbanks, the relocation of people living in flood-prone areas and a ban on further construction there.",1,0,3741,1.5,149,49,3218,914,News

The hearth is full with floodwater. My family did not receive any relief till this morning. My husband, two children and I are surviving on puffed rice that a neighbour gave us two days ago,” said Momota Begum of Decreer Char village in central Faridpur District. “There is no drinking water. No latrines around here. People are defecating indiscriminately on the slopes of the embankment.” Government officials say floodwaters have heavily eroded riverbanks and devoured some 80 villages since 9 September, most of them by the Brahmaputra river in the northwest. According to the country’s Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), although the situation in the northwest is expected to stabilize soon, officials predict it will deteriorate in the northeast over the weekend. As of 16 September, the government had distributed 1,135 tons of rice, US$27,000 in cash relief, and $34,150 in house building grants to affected people in 10 districts, Minister of Food and Disaster Management Abdur Razzaque told IRIN. “More relief is in the pipeline. We will do everything that we can to help those who have lost or left their homes due to the floods,” Razzaque said.

According to the Water Development Board (WDB), floods have washed away a large segment of a flood protection levee on the western bank of the Brahmaputra, forcing nearly 35,000 people in 60 villages from their homes in west-central Sirajganj District. “Rice, lentils, vegetables and other cash crops on 2,660 hectares of land in Shahzadpur sub-district of Sirajganj have been destroyed,” said Abdul Zaher Ali, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension.

""It was pain in addition to the pain of losing the crop.""Flood waters that rushed through his home in rural Jigawa state now cover about 34 square miles (55 square kilometers) of farmland there. As the bright sun begins to slowly dry the fields, all the farmers have are ruined stalks and dying plants -- the latest strain on food in a region where other nearby countries face serious shortages.The floods have come at the worst possible time -- just before harvest -- when it is too late for farmers to replant their fields of millet, sorghum and cowpea, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.In northern Nigeria, unusually heavy seasonal rains sent water surging through overflowing rivers. A dam failed in the northern state of Sokoto, flooding out rural pasturelands there and killing about 40 people, according to local media reports.In Jigawa, local officials blame the inundation on officials opening two dams at reservoirs in neighboring Kano state. Typically, the water released yearly from the dams flows into farm fields across the region known as the Sahel, a band of semi-arid land stretching across Africa south of the Sahara. The waters irrigated the crops of Jigawa, a state home to more than 4 million people.This time, a huge wave of water from the reservoirs raced through already saturated stream and creek beds, quickly topping over Jigawa state's simple earthen levees, said Umar Kyari, a spokesman for Gov. Sule Lamido.About 2 million people -- about half of the state's population -- have been displaced or affected by the flooding that began two weeks ago, he said.The village of Gudinchin -- home to a few hundred people once surrounded by fields of tomatoes, corn, rice and millet -- is now cut off from the rest of Jigawa, an island in the midst of murky, fast-moving water ripe with unprocessed sewage. Besides swimming, the only way across comes from two, low-riding wooden canoes donated by the government.There, the dirt-walled granary quickly became a pile of muddy debris when the waters rushed in one night. Villagers used its walls to build an earthen levee against the rushing water. The millet able to be eaten can now be lifted up in only two handfuls.Garba Gudinchin, 55, said he and others live in fear that their dam won't hold long enough to allow the sun to burn away the remaining water. But beyond that, nearly all the village's crops now sit in ruin.""I cannot tell you the figure because it is big,"" he said in the local Hausa language.Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, relies on the crop from its northern states to feed the mouths of those in its oil-rich and commerce-driven south.Kyari, the governor's spokesman, warned the loss of crops would drive up food prices in the country, where most earn less than $1 a day. Kyari also estimates state ranchers lost millions of dollars worth of cattle in the flooding.The nation's farmers also supply other West African nations with their crops, countries already facing droughts and food shortages.In neighboring Niger, international aid experts warn the country faces the worst hunger crisis in its history following a prolonged drought and poor growing season last year. One of the poorest countries in Africa, Niger now has more than 7 million people -- almost 50 percent of the population -- suffering from a lack of food, officials say.Gautam Chatterjee, head of mission in Nigeria for Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors without Borders, said the flooding could affect the region for the next two to three months.""In the longer term, this means an increase in food insecurity and an increase in malnutrition, especially for children under 5,"" Chatterjee said.For now, villagers in Gudinchin who lost their homes, like Mohammed Auwal, live with their neighbors. Flood waters washed away his home and those of his immediate family. His crops, which once stood out against the gray dirt of the farm fields nearby, can no longer be seen.""It's all destroyed,"" Auwal said"" September 20, 2010: ""Abuja — The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has traced the cause of the devastating flooding that ravaged communities in Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi States to the release of large volume of water from the Goronyo Dam in Sokoto State; and warns that so far, other rivers and streams on that routes may be affected, especially in communities in Niger and Kwara States that host the Kanji dam.The acting Director General of the agency, Dr. Charles Agbo further explained that rather than using helicopters to monitor the areas of the flood, the agency has triggered the UN-SPIDER for the imageries of the extent of the flooding in both Sokoto and Kebbi States.He added that UN-SPIDER, based in Vienna, is United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response aimed at providing universal access to all types of space-based information and services relevant to disaster management by being a gateway to space information for disaster management support and serving as a bridge to connect the disaster management and space communities.In a press release, signed by Yushau A. Shuaib, Head of Press and Public Relations, NEMA, Agbo was quoted as speaking after reassessing the extent of damages in Kebbi State where 30 villages and towns were adversely affected by flood that uprooted corpses from their graves; contaminated water, destroyed large farmlands and killed animals.He urged states to harness the potentials of huge water as resources for agriculture and preservation for future usage. He also advised the states to be adequately prepared for heavy flooding to avoid another catastrophe. He recommended that the governments should build barriers along river banks and move people away from low-lying places by the rivers and adopt strategic measures to control the flood.According to the statement, apart from distributing relief material to Katsina, Sokoto over similar incidents, the agency has responded to the plights of thousands victims that are being accommodated in Internally Displaced Persons camps in Argungu and Augi local government councils in the states with four truckloads of relief materials including foods, beverages, disinfectants, detergent, beddings, clothing and medicationsGovernor Saidu Dakingari while commending the NEMA's intervention in the rescue operation blamed the incidents on lack of maintenance of the dams especially Goronyo, Bakolori and Lubu that have either overflown the edges or collapsed due to poor infrastructure that cannot withstand the floods."" September 13, 2010: "" Thousands, including women and children from several villages have been displaced by flood in Argungu, Kebbi State, even as thousands are trapped and cannot be reached. The flood was caused by a spillover from Goronyo dam in Sokoto state.LEADERSHIP SUNDAY investigations reveal that already, Matan Fada, Mala, Gobirawa, Tungar Barke da Tungar Dangwari areas have been submerged. Other local governments affected are Gada, Illela, Gwadabawa, Goronyo, Wurno, Binji, Tangaza, Kware, Wamakko, Bodinga, S/Birni and Sokoto North.The situation was further compounded by the collapse of Danbachaka dam, built 20 years ago. Although the trapped victims could not be reached, there are indications that lives may have been lost.Yusuf Dingyadi, an indigene of the town told LEADERSHIP SUNDAY that victims of the flood are sheltered in Tiggi, Bubuce, and Kantakwale Secondary Schools, with the hospital in a chaotic condition. ""Some victims suffered shock and fatigue, while some animals were drowned. Few lives may have been lost.

Several roads remain closed because of the threat of further damage.""Water got under the roads' surfaces and you get heavy vehicles on that and they start to crumble,"" Cr Dobson said. Farmers had also reported damage to their canola and wheat crops.Cr Dobson said tourist businesses were suffering, with operators reporting many cancelled reservations. He urged Melburnians not to be dissuaded from visiting, saying the town was ""alive and alert and up and about"". In Wangaratta, which was flooded after the King and Ovens rivers burst their banks, most of the damage was in nearby rural areas.Wangaratta mayor Anthony Griffiths said there had been an ""enormous amount of damages to fences"" and to some country roads, where the asphalt seal had been washed away.

Residents in Victoria's north-east are assessing the damage after floods inundated towns overnight.Euroa, Benalla and Myrtleford residents have been evacuated and say it is the worst flooding they have seen in 17 years. Water overflowing from Seven Creek in Euroa peaked about 7:30pm yesterday at just over five metres. Authorities warned about 100 households to evacuate. By 10pm most people at the relief centre set up at a school had returned home. In nearby Benalla, water from the swollen Broken River was still rising at midnight. Two relief centres have been set up in the town. The SES says it is not yet clear how many homes were flooded.More than a dozen homes in Carisbrook in the state's south-west are under threat from floods.Residents in Gippsland are also being urged to prepare for possible flooding.Wangaratta is not under threat, but authorities expect water levels there could peak by tomorrow. Many calls also came from Melbourne overnight after strong winds lashed the city, bringing down powerlines, trees and a shed roof. In the eastern suburb of Glen Waverley, one primary school had its roof blown off.The Bureau of Meterology's Stephen King says the rain will ease today.""Most of the worst stuff has obviously gone through but we'll still see some stream showers in the westerly flow today,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Victorian Government has announced relief funds for people affected by the floods.People who cannot go home and need basic financial help will be eligible for grants of about $1,000.Larger grants of about $26,000 will be available for those whose homes have been structurally damaged.The Operations Manager from the SES in Wangaratta, Alan Barnard, says the grants will be a welcome relief for people whose homes have flooded.""From what I can see at the moment I think there's certainly going to be a significant number of people who are going to be able to take up those grants,"" he said.""I think it's great the Government has got on board so quickly to assist our people in their greatest time of need.""Stephen Warren from the SES says there is still an emergency situation in Victoria's north-east and Gippsland region. ""Rivers are still going to be rising over the next couple of days and creating issues for communities as the water goes downstream,"" he said.""Releases of 35,000 megalitres on the Macalister at Glenmaggie will result in downstream inundation of farmland and there is some risk that if discharges increases properties in the townships of Newry and will be at risk of inundation.""Many roads are now partially closed and drivers are being urged to be extremely cautious.Earlier yesterday, flash flooding forced the evacuation of homes in Ballarat and Clunes in the state's central west, while 100 people in Creswick were moved to the town hall. The highest rainfall so far has been recorded at Mount Buffalo in the north-east with 180 millimetres falling since the early hours of Saturday morning.Sewerage has now started to leak into a river in the north-east.The Department of Human Services say the floods have caused the Ovens River north of Wangaratta to overflow.Residents in the area, including Peechelba and beyond, are being asked to boil all water for three minutes before use and avoid contact with the river.Mr Warren says the floodwaters could be around for up to a week, and is warning people not to drive through flooded roads or play in floodwaters.""Floodwaters are dangerous.

""Over the last decade, Mercy Corps has developed a relationship of trust and respect with the North Korean people,"" said Jim White, Mercy Corps Vice President of Program Operations. ""At this critical time, we want to reach out to families who are suffering huge losses as a result of flooding."" The UN estimates that in hard-hit North Pyongan province, flooding has heavily damaged or destroyed more than 7,100 homes, and 17,790 acres of farmland have been submerged or washed away. Heavy rains have washed out numerous bridges and railway lines, and created widespread power and telecommunications outages. The flooding has also jeopardized North Korea's already-fragile agricultural capacity, reportedly inundating or washing away valuable crop lands - sparking fears of widespread food shortages. Mercy Corps has worked with vulnerable North Korean families and communities since 1996, striving to help meet health and nutritional needs as well as collaborating on long-term agricultural and economic solutions. In 2008, Mercy Corps was the lead of five aid agencies that implemented a groundbreaking USAID-funded food program in Chagang and North Pyongan Provinces. The organization's co-founder, Ells Culver, reached out to the North Korean people after the country suffered years of drought, flooding and food shortages. That diplomacy has led to an extraordinary partnership that includes farmer exchanges between North Korea and the United States' Pacific Northwest. Mercy Corps has long been at the forefront of efforts to bring reconciliation and mutual understanding to the sometimes-contentious relationship between North Korea and the United States. Through the East Asia Advisory Committee and National Committee for North Korea, Mercy Corps is bringing together various stakeholders to discuss ideas for collaboration.

Some residents added that junta authorities had done nothing to help the displaced taking refuge in schools and temples, and one official even said residents should have prepared for the floods and taken care of themselves. Reports today said waters in the city were receding, after the government weather bureau, the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology Department, said yesterday that the level of the Pegu River was still rising at 11.30 a.m., without giving exact rate or height. However, state-run media reported today that the level of the Pegu River had reached 30 feet (924 centimetres) at noon yesterday, 5.5 inches above the “danger mark”.  Hundreds of flood victims were being sheltered in three Buddhist monasteries on the outskirts of the city. Though exact numbers of flood victims were unavailable to Mizzima, residents and monks in the areas estimated that the number was definitely more than 3,000.“Today, the water has receded and the situation is not bad as it was. Yesterday, many people became homeless and there are more than 500 taking shelter in my monastery,” an abbott from one of the monasteries said. Mizzima learned yesterday that about 5,000 homes on Shwe Thar Liaung Road, and in the Kyaukkyisuu, Zaiganaing, Ywathit and Kyuntharyar wards of Pegu, were evacuated as floodwaters rose. All schools in those areas were closed.Prahita monastery Abbot Keik Ti and his devotees yesterday distributed food packets to flood victims in the city, but a resident said yesterday that “even motorcycles and cars were facing difficulty commuting”. “We could not even reach the market. All businesses and shops have closed. It will be difficult to clean the debris … even after the water receded,” a resident near Shwemawdaw pagoda said.

However, a Pegu Peace and Development Committee official placed the responsibility for emergency aid back in the hands of residents. “The Pegu River experiences floods every year. The daily papers also warned that the river was rising to a danger level. They [residents] need to prepare for disaster management. The flood is not unusual for the people of Pegu”, the official said.

The level had started rising late on Saturday and the newspaper warned the next day it would soon reach the danger line. According to the weather bureau, this is the second flood in Pegu this year.

Authorities said fast-moving water hindered their search efforts earlier in the day.Polk County Deputy Keith Onley declined to identify the girl.The cars were swept off the road between Altoona and Mitchellville about 4 a.m. Rescuers found 10 of the 11 passengers clinging to trees and hanging onto logs. Four were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.Doug Phillips, a division chief with the Polk County Sheriff's Office, said the creek is usually only 3 feet deep and 10 feet wide but early Wednesday morning, ""it looked like a river.""In Ames, about 30 miles north of Des Moines, officials shut off the city's water supply at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday after a water main broke beneath the flooded Squaw Creek. The break drained a city water tower, dropping pressure in the distribution system and raising the possibility the system's water could become contaminated.Officials warned anyone who still had access to water to boil it before consuming it. They said repairs could take up to 24 hours.Several hundred Ames residents were evacuated from their homes after 3 to 5 inches of rain pushed Squaw Creek and Skunk River over their banks, Fire Chief Clint Petersen said. In some spots, water was up to car windshields.The floor at Hilton Coliseum, Iowa State's basketball arena, was covered with up to 5 feet of water, school spokesman John McCarroll said. It was too soon to know how much damage had been done, he said.Jack Trice football stadium was still dry, surrounded by sandbags football players had stacked as a precaution.But the parking lot between the two stadiums, where tailgaters party before games, was flooded.""I hope they get it cleared out by football season,"" student Sam Stonehocker said.In all, eight campus buildings had flood damage, McCarroll said.The Iowa Department of Transportation closed Interstate 35 just south of Ames and both lanes of U.S. Highway 30 in the area were closed.Elsewhere in Ames, Howe's Welding and Metal Fab had several feet of water inside it, even though the owners had been sandbagging all night. Piper Wall, whose husband owns the business, said it was difficult to assess the damage while the water remained, but it appeared worse than in 1993, when much of the area was underwater.""It will be when all this comes out and all the mud that remains and the machining tools and electric stuff that's not high enough,"" Wall said. ""In 1993, it was $150,000 and this year it's higher.""Downriver from Ames, the town of Colfax was nearly cut off by the rising Skunk River. Roads were covered by water, and people used boats to help neighbors move to higher ground.Colfax Mayor David Mast said he expected more than 200 homes would flood, and some were already inundated with about 4 feet of water. City officials had asked at least 300 residents on the west side of town to move to higher ground, Mast said.After Heather Kern was asked to leave at 12:30 a.m., she rushed to move possessions out of the home she shared with her husband, two children and three other relatives. When sirens sounds a few hours later, the family had to evacuate.Kern's basement was flooded, and water was inching into the first floor with waste-high water in the backyard.""I feel blessed that we have our lives,"" Kern said. ""We don't know where we're going to live or where we're going to stay, but we have our lives.""Colfax flooded in 1993, when the Skunk River reached a record of over 21.5 feet, more than 4 feet over flood stage.

The chances of finding more survivors were falling by the hour, but soldiers on Wednesday rescued a 50-year-old man who had been trapped in knee-deep mud on the second floor of a hotel, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.Troops and rescue teams joined by traumatized survivors turned to recovering bodies and seeing to the needs of the living. Clean drinking water was a primary concern, with most local sources destroyed or too polluted to use.Entire communities in Gansu province's Zhouqu district were swallowed up when the debris-choked Bailong River jumped its banks Sunday, releasing wave after wave of mud and rubble-strewn water. While torrential rains were the direct cause, tree cutting that left the dry hills exposed and the weakening of cliff faces by a massive 2008 earthquake were seen as contributing factors.Buildings were torn from their foundations, their lower floors blown out by the force of the debris-laden water. Three villages comprising hundreds of households were entirely buried and much of the county seat left submerged.""In some households, all the people have died,"" making the counting of the dead more difficult, Zhang Weixing, a Ministry of Civil Affairs official, told a news conference Wednesday.Crews using explosives and excavators rushed to drain an unstable lake on the Bailong upriver of Zhouqu, fearing more rain could cause a massive breach, bringing more misery to the town.""The danger of the barrier lake collapsing has been basically eliminated,"" Jiao Yong, deputy vice minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, told the news conference.Disinfectant crews in protective suits sprayed chemicals across the ground and over machinery, the smell of death heavy in the air. State media reported numerous cases of dysentery, while infected injuries, a lack of sanitation, clean drinking water and accumulating garbage increased the risk of typhoid, cholera and other diseases.But the deputy director of the Health Ministry's emergency office, Zhang Guoxin, said there have been no reports of an epidemic outbreak.Rescue crews have been largely reliant on hand tools, with heavy equipment either unable to traverse the difficult terrain or mired in mud up to several yards (meters) deep.But roads reopened Wednesday, allowing heavy earth-moving equipment and supplies to flow in.At least 45,000 people have evacuated their homes, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs reported the delivery of 30,000 tents to the area, with thousands more on the way. Zhouqu has a population of 134,000, but it wasn't clear how many needed emergency shelter.Shen Si, a member of the Tibetan ethnic group native to the area, watched forlornly as troops dug to reach the bodies of her relatives inside their buried home.""My mother and father in their 60s and my younger brother, all three of them, are buried here in our house still,"" she said.Throughout the area, bodies were seen wrapped in blankets and tied to sticks or placed on planks and left on the shattered streets for pickup.China's leadership has ordered teams to continue the search for survivors, and the ruling Communist Party's all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee met Tuesday to discuss rescue and relief work.""It is now a critical time ... we must give the highest prominence to the protection of people's lives and properties,"" it said in a statement.Flooding in China has killed about 1,800 people this year "" More heavy downpours are expected today through Friday across northeastern Jilin Province where more than 100 people have been killed due to flooding and consequent landslides.Analysts are divided over a possible decrease in grain production due to the flooding that may lead to price hikes and hamper government efforts to contain inflation.In Tonghua, imminent rain is likely to daunt workers who had been rushing to repair flood-damaged water pipelines, almost four days after more than 300,000 residents were left without tap water supplies, authorities said.It remained unclear when tap water would be restored, but authorities said 1.5 million bottles of water are available for emergency purposes, the Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday.In Baishan, workers were racing against time before the arrival of heavy rains, to clear an accumulation of garbage, up to one-meter thick and covering an area of 15,000 square meters, which blocked the flow of water under a bridge and threatened a downstream dam, Xinhua reported.Wang Yanbo, a resident in Yanji, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, told the Global Times that many buildings in the city have been damaged and some villages in Yanbian have become flooded.

As the disaster slowly unfolded, a world that had just opened its wallets for Haiti's earthquake victims was called upon to respond again. The militaries of the U.S., Japan and Australia joined the rescue effort, while other nations sent tents, medicines and relief goods.The U.N. says just over $760 million has so far been donated — less than half of what it says is needed to help all those affected Three months later, Associated Press correspondents visited towns and villages in the four hardest hit regions along the 4,000-km (2,500-mile) trail of destruction to witness a nation struggling to recover — with varying degrees of success.SWAT VALLEY, north Pakistan — The upper reaches of this valley are again passable — on a road hacked out of hillsides and over creaky bridges by villagers using shovels, pickaxes or their bare hands.The road stands as a tribute to their resolve to rebuild what was lost when the worst floods in memory hit the remote and scenic valley.But it takes 14 hours to drive its 50 kilometers (30 miles) of boulder-strewn dirt and bridges made of salvaged timber.

In the next field, children bounce on the back of a tractor turning soil.Many farmers in northwest Pakistan couldn't imagine growing a winter wheat crop this year, yet thousands are doing so, and others farther south will begin soon, easing fears of shortages in the country's staple food.Yet, nationwide the outlook remains bleak for many farmers, who account for most of the 20 million affected by the floods. Large areas of Sindh province in the south remain under water. Irrigation channels across the country have silted up, and over a million farm animals died in the devastation..Some officials see a comforting irony: They predict some bumper harvests because the floods dumped fresh nutrients on the soil.Farmers are less sure.

Information Minister Qamar Zaman said 722,000 homes have already been damaged and flooded roads are hampering relief efforts.The United Nations appealed for $460 million in aid today to assist at least six million people displaced by a wave of water that has descended on Pakistan’s economic heartland. Almost 700,000 hectares of standing crops are under water or destroyed by floodwaters, the Food and Agriculture Organization said. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. closed its Multan plant, which processes a third of the country’s crude oil.As many as 50 million people have been affected, John Holmes, the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, said in New York.“The number of people affected is much larger than the Pakistan earthquake of 2005, the tsunami,” that struck the Indian Ocean basin in 2004 or the magnitude 7.0 earthquake that devastated Haiti in January, Holmes told journalists.“Pakistan has never seen a disaster of this scale,” Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, the nation’s biggest rescue service, said by telephone from Peshawar, predicting at least 2,200 people may have died so far. “We need to rebuild everything from scratch and the biggest challenge is rehabilitation.”Southern Punjab province may face “critical flooding” between now and Aug. 14, Shafaqat Ahmed, the military commander for Multan said at a news conference today. A third flood peak may hit the area at the end of the month, he said.Cotton, rice, sugarcane and maize crops have been damaged and fruit orchards have been washed away by the monsoon rains, putting at risk the government’s farm output growth target of 3.8 percent for the year that started July 1.Almost two weeks after much of the northwest was first inundated, southern Sindh province is being ravaged by water flowing down the Indus at up to 10 times the normal volume.Jacobabad, Sukkur and Larkana are among districts at risk. Low-lying areas of Hyderabad, Pakistan’s sixth-largest city, may be inundated within 24 hours.“Our protective arrangements are all in place,” said Abdul Qadir Paleejo, executive engineer at the Kotri Barrage, a dam spanning the Indus 8 kilometers (5 miles) northwest of Hyderabad, a industrial city of 1.6 million people. “We have strengthened our embankments and protective walls.”City officials began evacuating residents yesterday. The Kotri Barrage is the last dam along the swollen Indus as flood waters make their way to the sea, leaving behind a trail of unprecedented destruction.Officials say the flood’s worst damage may be done at Hyderabad, the biggest population center directly on the 3,200- kilometer long Indus River. The city is home to textile mills and assembly plants for motorcycles and cars.“The barrage has the capacity to withstand a flow of 875,000 cubic feet per second, while the incoming tide is carrying a flow of 800,000,” Paleejo said from his office at the dam. “We are hoping it will pass without causing any damage.”Pakistan said yesterday it will waive farm loans and help rebuild homes for victims of the floods as the government and aid agencies acknowledged they are unable to reach or assist many of the 14 million uprooted so far.The floods have knocked Pakistan back to the “primordial” era, the country’s ambassador to the UN, Abdullah Haroon, told journalists in New York. “Six thousand villages have been wiped from the face of the earth.”The government will announce a sweeping rehabilitation package once it completes a survey of lives lost and damage to property, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan cited Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani as saying. A cross-party committee will coordinate relief activities, he said, after visiting camps in Muzaffargarh and Layyah.The World Bank said today it will assess needs and draft a reconstruction plan for affected regions.In Baluchistan province, “our stockpiles are nearly exhausted,” and trucks hauling tents have been blocked for a week by flooded roads, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in an e-mailed message.With more than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of Pakistan under water, the agency has delivered tents to people that have no dry land on which to pitch them.About 1,600 people are known to have died in Pakistan, and hundreds more in India and Afghanistan, from flooding caused by heavy monsoon rains. The death toll may jump as more inundated areas become accessible, Edhi said.Many people have died from the outbreak of diseases such as diarrhea and flood victims are in need of basic medicines, blankets and tents, Edhi said.At least 500,000 people made homeless in the northwest are seeking shelter in public buildings and tent camps erected on high ground and along roads, the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.The United States and Islamic militant groups, both pushing for influence in the world’s sixth-most populous country, have sent teams to help homeless villagers in areas of the ethnic Pashtun northwest that for two years have been combat zones.Pak-Arab Refinery’s plant at Multan, the nation’s biggest refinery, has been shut as a precaution due to the floods and may start supplying fuel within a week, company spokesman Saad Husain said by phone from Karachi. Natural gas output has fallen after floods forced the closure of a well at the Qadirpur field.The U.S. yesterday pledged an additional $20 million in emergency aid, bringing its total promised to $55 million, State Department spokesman Philip J.

The government said some 27,000 people remained trapped and awaiting help.Renewed rain on Tuesday slowed the relief effort, with criticism rising of the pace of the government response.In the Swat Valley, where thousands are still rebuilding after a major military operation against the Taliban during 2009, the flooding has brought down bridges and left communities cut off.""The civil administration is totally zero in helping,"" one medical student, Abdullah, told the BBC.""There [are] no aid agencies here at the moment - I haven't seen anyone, because more than 25 bridges have been swept away. These are the metal bridges for carrying transport."" The Malakand region, which includes Swat, is among the worst-affected areas. Villages in Malakand have suffered heavy casualties, with roads and bridges washed away.Adnan Khan, a spokesman for the disaster management authority in the worst-affected province, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, told Reuters news agency that logistics were now an immense challenge.""The entire infrastructure we built in the last 50 years has been destroyed,"" he said.The BBC's Lyse Doucet, in Islamabad, says the flooding would be a challenge in any country, but is a growing crisis for a country like Pakistan, already suffering economic woes and a Taliban insurgency.The return of monsoon rains has grounded helicopters and raised fears of renewed flooding.Forecasters said moderate to heavy rain would continue in the north-west and in southern provinces of Punjab and Sindh over the coming days.""Enhanced monsoon activity"" is also expected to continue during the first two weeks of August.Just as emergency services and the army said they were making some headway, the rains have come again. That has meant an immediate suspension of helicopter flights to stranded people.We've had about two hours of very heavy downpours. It has just eased up but more are expected in the coming hours - floodwaters could rise again and rivers will burst their banks again. Aid operations will have to be suspended for even longer.There are many areas the army admits that it has not reached at all. There are several valleys in the north-west of Pakistan where they do not know how many people have died or how much destruction there is. Time is now crucial for those people waiting for aid, who do not yet have food or clean water.The army had hoped that the initial rescue operation could be over in 10 days, but says rebuilding the damaged areas could take more than six months.Local official Mian Iftikhar Hussain said rescue teams were trying to reach 27,000 stranded people, including 1,500 tourists in the Swat Valley.But the biggest challenge for the emergency services is access, as so many areas had their transport and communication links destroyed and are now isolated.There are also concerns that yet more places could flood: a warning was issued to villages close to the Warsak Dam overnight, but no evacuation order was issued.The Pakistani military says it has committed 30,000 troops and dozens of helicopters to the relief effort, but winching individuals to safety is a slow process.Unconfirmed reports say that Islamist groups, some accused of having links to the Taliban, have been providing aid to many of the victims.Some survivors have complained that the government has responded slowly; several hundred people protested in the city of Peshawar, where homeless survivors have crammed into temporary shelters, and there have been angry scenes in Swat. In Nowshera district one flood victim, Faisal Islam, told the Associated Press: ""We need tents. Just look around. This is the only shirt I have. Everything else is buried.""Aid agencies say the risk of water-borne diseases spreading will remain high until the floodwaters fully recede. Mr Hussain, the regional information minister, said there were reports of cholera emerging in the Swat Valley.What aid is arriving in the flood zone is in high demand Ahmed Farah Shadoul, the World Health Organization's acting head in Pakistan, told the BBC it was essential to act against the spread of a number of infections, including diarrhoeal diseases, skin problems, eye problems, malaria, fevers and measles.The UN children's agency Unicef said more than a million children needed emergency aid.Dr Shadoul said he had received reports of people being bitten by snakes, and said WHO had provided anti-venom in some regions.Food is scarce in the area and water supplies have been contaminated by the floods.Unicef says it has been working with the Pakistani authorities to repair wells and provide chlorine tablets for drinking water.Governments around the world have pledged millions of dollars in aid, but there has been no decision yet on whether to launch a global appeal for aid."" ""ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The worst floods in memory in Pakistan have devastated the lives of more than 3 million people, a U.N. spokesman said on Tuesday, while outrage over the unpopular government's response to the suffering spreads.The catastrophe, which started almost a week ago and has killed more than 1,400 people, is likely to deepen as more rains are expected and a breakout of water-borne diseases such as cholera could create a health crisis.It has also called once again into question the leadership of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is already juggling a Taliban insurgency and chronic power cuts in the nuclear-armed U.S. ally.Poorly resourced Pakistani authorities are struggling to help flood victims, many of whom have lost everything and say they received no warnings that raging waters were heading their way.Anger was palpable in towns such as Charssada. A Reuters reporter saw people attacking trucks distributing relief items. Police then charged at them with batons.Bistma Bibi, 65, who lost two grandsons in the floods, accused state relief workers of only helping friends or relatives.

""Rivers burst their banks during monsoon rains, washing away streets, battering a dam and killing at least 60 people in the most severe floods in decades in northwest Pakistan, officials have said. Hundreds of thousands more were stranded as rescue workers struggled to reach far-flung villages.In the Peshawar area, two elderly men clung to a fence post and each other as a raging torrent swept over their heads, footage on Pakistan's Dunya TV showed. It was unclear whether they survived.People were forced to trudge through knee-deep water in some streets in the Swat Valley. A newly constructed part of a dam in the Charsadda district collapsed, while crops were soaked in many areas. At least 10 people died near Peshawar when their homes collapsed.Dozens of people were reported missing, including at least nine Chinese construction workers in the Kohistan area. Some 200 other Chinese workers were trapped amid the downpour, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister for Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, the province that has been deluged.He said it was the worst floods in the north-west since 1929 and estimated 400,000 people were stranded around the north-west.""A rescue operation using helicopters cannot be conducted due to the bad weather, while there are only 48 rescue boats available for rescue,"" he said, noting weather forecasts predict more rain over the next day.Monsoon season often leads to widespread flooding in Pakistan, and the poorest residents are often most at risk because flood-prone areas are all they can afford.The torrential rain this week is a suspected factor in a plane crash in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, that killed 152 people on Wednesday""""At least 43 killed as a result of monsoon rains and flooding across the country""",1,0,3696,2,105,40,3174,905,News

More left their houses Friday morning and sought shelter.Mayor James Wilson said a state of local emergency has been declared, adding that there has never been flooding to this extent before in the city of 15,000 people about 190 kilometres northeast of Regina.The storm sewer system was overwhelmed and many streets were under water, including sections of Broadway Street in the heart of the city. Power was turned off in sections of Yorkton.CBC Saskatchewan weather consultant Wayne Miskolczi said that according to Environment Canada 64 millimetres fell before midnight, and further heavy rain was recorded early Friday.""I'm sure there are spots in Yorkton that have had well over 100 millimetres,"" he said.Wilson said he's been told that some areas received 100 to 150 millimetres of rain in half an hour. An estimated 60 to 70 per cent of homes took in water, he said, and many businesses were flooded.Yorkton has had floods before, but not like this, Wilson said. ""Nothing to this extent."" He said some people had to be carried away in front-end loaders.The mayor added that Premier Brad Wall called him and assured him there will be quick provincial relief for people in need.An emergency evacuation centre was set up at the Gallagher Centre, the city's main recreational centre and fairground. People making their way there were told to stick to higher routes. Some flooded-out residents were seeking refuge in hotels as far away as Regina.""They were evacuating people in canoes,"" said Michael Paslofski, a spokesman with the Canadian Red Cross in Yorkton. ""If this rain comes again, we're going to be in big trouble.""A CBC reporter said one couple paddled a canoe to their home Friday morning to pick up some clothing.Additional room at the evacuation centre has been set aside in anticipation that there may be more problems later Friday. More thunderstorms were in the forecast.Record-setting amounts of rain have been dumped on Saskatchewan in recent weeks. In Saskatoon, city council passed an emergency resolution Friday morning asking the province for disaster relief following flooding earlier in the week.The town of Maple Creek in the southwest part of the province declared itself a disaster zone last month after more than 100 millimetres of rain fell in 48 hours"" July 5, 2010: ""Saskatchewan is pleading for anyone with ""a strong back and a willing heart"" to help the province dig out from a series of devastating storms.Duane McKay, the province's fire commissioner, says the Saskatchewan Emergency Management Organization has pulled in all its resources to deal with disasters across Saskatchewan.But McKay says volunteers are needed to move debris in Yorkton, where about 1,000 homes were damaged after heavy rain flooded basements and turned streets into canals last Thursday.Volunteers are needed to help people ""restore their lives a little bit,"" McKay said in a conference call Monday.""A strong back and a willing heart is probably what we're needing right now. It's basically removing whatever was in somebody's basement out and into dumpsters to be transported out or trying to salvage those things,"" he said.The flood has forced about 175 people from their homes. The water has receded but the damage is still being assessed. McKay said there is ""an increased level of emotion"" as people try to cope with the disaster. ""People are more concerned now about, 'What do I do next' and so we're seeing that begin to come forward in the community.""Yorkton residents aren't alone with their worries. More than 70 Saskatchewan communities have declared states of emergency due to bad weather.Severe flooding last month in Maple Creek, in southwestern Saskatchewan, flooded basements and collapsed a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway. Last Wednesday, Saskatoon had what its mayor called ""one of those one-in-100-year floods"" when the city received 80 millimetres of rain in three hours.At least 100 people have been left homeless near the town of Raymore and on the Kawacatoose First Nation, where a tornado touched down Friday.Emergency officials said well over a dozen homes are in ruins or badly damaged on the reserve, along with four farms in the region.Environment Canada has surveyed the damage and determined it was an F3 tornado on the Fujita tornado damage scale, which means winds were roaring as high as 330 kilometres an hour. The scale has a maximum rating of F5.Meteorologist Dan Kulak said in a conference call Monday that the twister was about 500 metres wide, cut a path 45 kilometres long — crossing two highways — and may have been on the ground for as long as one hour.""That would be a fairly lengthy storm,"" said Kulak.""Typically tornadoes will be on the ground for only a few minutes, but the odd time you do get these storms which do last a considerable amount of time and cover a lot of distance. So a one-hour tornado on the ground that peaks at an F3 is an unusual storm. It's not an extremely, extremely rare event but certainly it is in the less common end of things.""Kulak said F3 tornadoes probably occur once every two to three years on Prairies.It was an F3 tornado that carved a 20-kilometre path of destruction through an Alberta campground on July 14, 2000. The twister at Pine Lake killed 12 people and injured more than 100.Residents near Raymore and on the Kawacatoose First Nation say it's a miracle that no one was killed or even seriously injured during the tornado Friday.Kulak said ""it's been wave after wave"" of storms across the Prairies.The meteorologist said he doesn't have a specific forecast through to the end of August, but he suggested there might be more bad weather to come.""Certainly if history is going to be any indication of the future here, when we do get into patterns like this — a lot of rain and a lot moisture that happens to be in the area — you're that much more susceptible to further thunderstorm activity,"" said Kulak.""You tend to recycle. A lot of that moisture, as it evaporates during the day, becomes fuel for the next set of storms.""",1,0,3673,1.5,82,30,3151,895,0

The small plane carrying Piedras Negras Mayor Jose Manuel Maldonado was flying over a rain-swollen reservoir about 25 miles east of Eagle Pass, Texas, when it went down, said Ricardo Castillo, a spokesman for the border state of Coahuila. State spokeswoman Irma Flores said there were no survivors. She said the dead included state Public Works Director Horacio Del Bosque, the pilot and three other people. The cause of the crash was still under investigation. The officials were surveying the condition of reservoirs along the U.S.-Mexico border, which have reached their highest levels in decades following days of drenching rain. That has forced officials to dump water into flooded rivers, with yet another storm on the way. The dramatic rise of the Rio Grande caused by Hurricane Alex and continuing rains forced the closure of at least one major border crossing between downtown Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Officials evacuated the flood-threatened Vega Verde subdivision in Del Rio, Texas, some 110 miles upstream from Laredo, while high waters in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila have already damaged some 10,000 homes - many swamped in waist-deep water. ""That means there are 40,000 people who don't have any place to sleep,"" Gov. Humberto Moreira told the Televisa network on Wednesday. To the southeast, Mexican officials evacuated nearly 18,000 people from houses in Ciudad Anahuac for fear that water would overflow the Venustiano Carranza dam and threaten lives. Mexico's National Water Commission said the dam currently had the largest emergency water release in the country. Ciudad Anahuac Mayor Santos Garza Garcia said at least 1,500 homes already had been flooded in the town of Rodriguez, across the Salado River from his city. Water behind the binational Amistad Dam on the Rio Grande was at its highest level since 1974, according to the International Boundary and Water Commission, forcing officials to release water from it at the fastest rate in a quarter century. The Commission said the downstream Falcon dam would probably reach capacity within the next few days, suggesting future releases there will raise water levels along the river's lower reaches. Much of that downstream area is protected against flooding by levees, but Mexico's National Water Commission said it was worried about low-lying settlements, most built by poor people without official permission. ""One of country's most serious problems are irregular settlements on federal land and in flood-prone areas,"" it said. Authorities walked a painful, delicate line - forced to release reservoir waters they know will add to flooding in hopes of avoiding worse disasters. It was an unusual state of affairs in a semiarid region where Mexican and U.S. officials often squabble over rights to scarce water. Mayor Garza Garcia said 20 floodgates had been opened by late Tuesday at the Venustiano Carranza Dam, which was releasing 600 cubic meters per second into the Salado River, a tributary of the Rio Grande. ""It was preferable having controlled flooding than having the whole town disappear,"" Garza Garcia said. ""The situation is very critical."" Luis Lobo, who drove 16 people from Ciudad Anahuac to Nuevo Laredo, said hundreds of people from Ciudad Anahuac and nearby villages left by foot and were by the side of the road. ""They are out in the open. Men, women, and children with nothing to eat,"" Lobo said after arriving in Nuevo Laredo. Garza Garcia said soldiers planned to take food to those stranded. Sally Spener, public affairs officer for the binational Water Commission that operates the Amistad Dam, said the agency had tried to limit releases ""so that we would not exacerbate the flooding."" In Laredo, city spokeswoman Xochitl Mora said Bridge One was closed as a precaution ahead of the expected crest on Thursday. The water is expected to rise to 38.5 feet high enough to touch but not run over the bridge. Officials will remove the heavy steel shade canopies to ease the weight on Bridge One before the heaviest water pressure comes with the river crest, she said. About 11,000 pedestrians and 13,000 vehicles use the bridge daily. Officials were also evacuating 2,000 people near the swollen Rio Escondido, said Piedras Negras Mayor Jose Manuel Maldonado. And in Texas authorities evacuated the Vega Verde neighborhood of Del Rio was evacuated as more water was being released from the Amistad Lake, just upstream. One of three international bridges connecting Laredo, Texas and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, was ordered closed as the Rio Grande rose dramatically. The water is expected to rise to 38.5 feet - high enough to touch but not run over the bridge. The other two Laredo bridges, including the heavily used World Trade Bridge, are expected to remain open. Hurricane Alex dumped heavy rains on the region last week, causing flooding that killed at least 12 people in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, where Ciudad Anahuac is located, and leaving some 130,000 without water service. The U.S. National Weather Service said a new storm was likely to make its way across the Gulf of Mexico and hit the region within a day or two. "" July 6, 2010: ""Hundreds of people have been evacuated and a border bridge closed in northern Mexico after days of rain caused flooding and water to swell behind a dam.Authorities in Coahuila state have closed the border bridge in Ciudad Acuna as a precautionary measure after water released from the Amistad dam raised the level of the Rio Grande. Ciudad Acuna lies across the border from Del Rio, Texas.Coahuila Gov. Humberto Moreira told local media Monday that about 10,000 people have suffered severe damage to their homes or possessions due to the flooding.The release of water from the Amistad dam raises the possibility that river levels could rise downstream in Piedras Negras, a city across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas"" . July 2, 2010: ""At least six people have died during heavy flooding in Mexico. The victims were killed in and around the northern city of Monterrey following storms caused by Hurricane Alex. One woman was crushed to death by a mudslide as large rocks from surrounding mountains crashed down onto her car. President Felipe Calderon said that 1,200 had been dispatched to help in the relief efforts.Hurricane Alex hit Mexico's Gulf Coast on Wednesday and moved inland. A year's worth of rain fell in three days in Monterrey, swelling the normally dry Santa Catarina river, which overflowed and destroyed homes and sections of roads. Tens of thousands of home are now without water or power and many residents have evacuated in search of emergency shelters."" July 1, 2010: ""Hurricane Alex has brought torrential rain as it weakened to a tropical storm over northeastern Mexico, flooding the city of Monterrey. At least two people were killed when a river burst its banks, inundating roads and washing away cars. Alex was a category two hurricane when it hit the Gulf coast on Wednesday night, but lost force as it moved inland. It was expected to dissipate over the Mexican highlands on Friday.The usually dry Santa Catarina river that runs through the centre of Monterrey turned into a raging torrent, flooding major highways and paralysing Mexico's third-biggest city. One man died after he was swept nearly 500 metres by the waters and trapped against a fence. The body of another drowned man was found in a creek.A 12-tonne statue of the revered Virgin of Guadalupe was knocked off its plinth on the river bank. Flood waters also hit the city zoo, sweeping animals including buffalo from their pens, the Reuters news agency reported. Alex was the first hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic season, and the first to appear in June since 1995. It caused severe flooding along Mexico's Gulf coast when it made landfall on Wednesday night.

""The city is practically under water"" the director of civil defence, Saul Hernandez, told the AP news agency. ""But the most important thing is there was no loss of life. We took opportune measures to evacuate people"" Thousands of people in coastal villages were moved to higher ground before the storm hit. Many towns were left without electricity, and phone lines were also down. Heavy seas caused by the storm also disrupted BP's oil spill clean-up in the Gulf of Mexico. Alex largely spared the US state of Texas, which had prepared for a possible direct hit. It brought heavy rain and caused at least two tornadoes, but there were no reports of injuries or major damage. However, there are still warnings of possible flash-flooding in some areas of the state.""July 1, 2010: ""Alex has drenched much of northern Mexico, paralysing the major city of Monterrey.

Power and telephone service were down in several towns and cities. The storm weakened to a tropical storm as it moved west to Nuevo Leon state, but still caused major disruptions.One man died when he was swept away by a torrent of water along a six-lane highway, city Civil Protection director Pedro Trevino told Televisa Monterrey network. Another man was found drowned by side of a creek.Nuevo Leon state governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz told the network he had ordered all schools closed and appealed for people to stay home from all but essential jobs.

(CBC)Motorists who had their vehicles damaged during the storms have also begun to file claims with Manitoba Public Insurance.So far, more than 200 flood-related claims have been filed, said MPI spokesman Brian Smiley.About half the claims come from Winnipeg, where many vehicles sustained damage after going through underpasses filled with water and becoming partially submerged.Other vehicles were hit by debris, even trees, tossed about by strong winds. Claims from outside the city are vehicles damaged because they were parked in low-lying areas and were swamped.Flooding across city Calls to the city about flooded basements came from nearly every neighbourhood and are not concentrated in one area, officials said. ""It doesn't make you happy when you see people moving out mattresses and beds to their back yards and having to get pumps to pump out the water,"" said Mayor Sam Katz, who viewed some of the damage Sunday in the city's Transcona neighbourhood.""There were some very bad scenarios."" A sign for the golf cart path is nearly submerged on the flooded Transcona golf course Sunday. (Richard Romanow)In addition to seeping into basements, the rain washed debris into streets and clogged drains, which resulted in the development of large pools of water spreading across streets and into yards.Some roadways were barricaded to keep vehicles from passing through dangerously deep water.Transcona resident John Tubicz was at a local hardware store at noon Sunday and watched people frantically buy up the stock of pumps to get water out of their basements.""People were racing to the sump pumps and within seconds the shelf was empty,"" he said.He estimates the damage in his basement at a few thousand dollars.'You know, I can't cry.

It's beyond that point.""Problems at the pumps Some of the problems in South Transcona can be traced back to a problem at the pumping station that serves the area, said Randy Hull, Winnipeg's emergency preparedness coordinator.""All three pumps at one point had failed. When I visited there about 2:30 a.m. [Monday] they were not operational, but when I went by at 8:30 a.m. they were in operation,"" he said.Despite the faulty pumps, the city is not responsible for flooded basements in the area because the storm was an act of God, Hull said.In Brandon, the thunderstorms did much of the same damage to yards and basements, while also uprooting several trees across the city. Rick Bailey, director of parks and recreation, said the clean-up should take all week.""[The] soil's just become so saturated, and then when you get that wind that come through, that's where a lot of the trees come over,"" he said.The Assiniboine Community College's North Hill campus was badly hit with about 25 toppled trees.Rising riverThe rainfall has also raised the level of the Red River and prompted officials to activate the floodway, a 48-kilometre channel that diverts water around the eastern side of Winnipeg.Flood Forecaster Alf Warkentin said the Red River in through Winnipeg went up nearly three metres on the weekend and could rise another half-metre by the end of Tuesday.Most of the tributaries leading into the Red and Assiniboine River have emptied, so the rate of the increase is dropping off.High river levels in Winnipeg impact the city sewer system's ability to operate at a normal capacity. That means there is an increased risk of basement flooding as the overloaded system backs up through household sewer lines that aren't protected by sump pumps and backwater valves.""",1,0,3655,1,65,25,3134,890,0

The situation is critical in six locations of Amoni, Osuret, Asing'e, Among'ura, Kamolo and Osajai with rivers Malakisi and Malaba bursting their banks.This has rendered many families homeless and seeking refuge on trees and hilltops.Floods in Salabani location, Marigat District in Rift Valley province have displaced some 1 520 people. In Sasur Location, Mt Elgon district, 21 families have been identified for immediate relocation amid fears of landslides due to the ongoing heavy rains.The floods, which started on Monday, have submerged six of the seven villages in Salabani sub location.""

El Nino weather patterns across the region are blamed for the flooding and landslides that have destroyed roads and buildings and killed scores in east Africa’s biggest economy. “We only have one metre of space left before Masinga dam starts overflowing and that will consequently cause the overflow of Kiambere, Gitaru dams setting off major flooding in northeastern and eastern Kenya,” said Colonel Vincent Anami, the head of the national disaster operations centre. An evacuation exercise is already under way which will move thousands of people living close to River Tana, Anami said by telephone.

At least nine people died in vehicles in Tennessee. Others were found in their homes or yards, including an elderly couple discovered in their Nashville home. A 21-year-old Nashville resident died when he tried to wade the waters in front of his home but got swept away in the current.Sections of downtown and some of Music City's popular tourist attractions remained flooded Tuesday, including the Grand Ole Opry House and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Full damage estimates were unavailable, but the Opryland Hotel alone suffered more than $75 million in damage; it will be closed for three to six months.The storm dumped more than a foot of rain from Saturday to Sunday, sending floodwaters rising rapidly in the middle of the night.Residents in some of the hardest hit areas said they didn't know if they should flee or stick it out for fear that if they left their homes, they would be swept away by the muddy waters that turned streets into virtual rivers.""We had less than an hour to get out,"" said Amanda Fatherree.

""And of course it was very clear by Sunday that we were in a very serious situation.""Flash flood watches were issued on Friday, but National Weather Service meteorologist Larry Vannozzi said the service also took the rare step on Saturday to relay an emergency message warning people to stay off the roads.""We didn't just barely beat the record and we didn't beat it by a decent amount.

Searches were continuing for around another 200 people still missing in Rio's satellite town of Niteroi"". NITEROI: Rescuers raced against time yesterday amid fading hopes of finding survivors of a huge mudslide, with over 400 people now feared dead in some of the worst flooding to swamp Brazil in decades. Rescuers painstakingly pulled bodies from the thick mound of dirt and debris in the Niteroi shantytown of Morro do Bumba late on Friday and yesterday, bringing the death toll to 223. Another 200 people were feared to have been buried alive in the slum, itself precariously perched atop a garbage dump in this city just east of Rio de Janeiro. Some 60 hours after the heaviest rains in half a century unleashed floods and mudslides, rescue workers still were far from having finished the work of recovering bodies from beneath tonnes of rocks, rubble and earth. The floods tore through the metropolitan area’s precarious hillside slums, or favelas. Niteroi was hardest hit, with at least 141 dead, according to the civil defence authorities. Across the bay, another 63 were found in Rio de Janeiro. April 7: ""Rio de Janeiro braced for more rain today as the death toll from flooding climbed to 104 and order slowly returned to Brazil's second-biggest city that was thrown into chaos a day earlier. Rio's mayor said traffic had improved after the heaviest rains in at least three decades yesterday turned highways into lakes, left commuters and residents stranded and sparked mudslides that crushed houses in hillsides slums. ""From the point of view of mobility, the situation is better than yesterday,"" Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters at an early morning press conference. He urged residents to postpone meetings and avoid travelling in the city if possible. Schools remained shut for a second day. The government weather service predicted rain would continue until Saturday even after clouds broke briefly and rains eased this morning. A Fire Department spokesman said 39 people were killed in the city of Rio, famous for its beaches and Carnaval celebrations, while the remainder of the casualties took place in suburbs and in neighboring cities and town of the state of Rio de Janeiro. In the nearby city of Niteroi, residents desperately searched for survivors in rubble left from 10 houses that collapsed from a mudslide, the Globo network reported. ""I lost my sister-in-law and a niece, and my nephew and brother-in-law are still missing,"" nurse Samuel Franca, who managed to rescue his sister from the wreckage the day before, told Globo. Globo images showed buses struggling to drive through flooded streets in western parts of the city, though transit had largely returned to normal in the central business district. Paes called on those living in hillside slums at risk for mudslides - which were responsible for most of yesterday's deaths - to leave their homes as the rains continued. ""Their lives are at risk,"" Paes added. Brazil's popular football team Flamengo postponed a match with a rival team from Chile because of the rains. The mayor yesterday said 1,200 people had been made homeless and that 10,000 houses remained at risk, mostly in the slums where about a fifth of Rio's people live, often in precarious shacks that are vulnerable to heavy rains. Television images yesterday showed central parts of Rio flooded and abandoned cars under water. Near Copacabana beach, residents waded through ankle-deep water on their way to work.

The bodies were swept 10 kilometres downstream, he said.This brings the number of the dead from the floods to nine.And the Red Cross is also warning that the situation in the Tana Delta could become critical if the rains are to continue and the dams on the Seven Forks Hydroelectric project get full.""The water could be released downstream and the people on the Tana Delta will therefore need to be on the lookout if the rains continue,"" said Mr Mung'ou on the telephone.He said reports from the Lake Victoria and Budalangi flood monitoring systems indicate rivers in that area are close to overflowing their banks. He said the rivers are about 0.2 metres away from breaking their banks and residents would have to move to higher ground immediately.Water from the Cherangany Hills and Mt Elgon are the main cause of the river's perennial flooding.The number of those who have been left homeless also increased after about 70 families lost their semi-permanent houses to floods in Migori and Uriri districts in South Nyanza.The residents of Oruba, Pand Pieri, Nyasare and Rapogi estates were left without shelter after their mud-walled houses were brought down by the heavy rains that have pounded the region for the last three days.He urged area residents to avoid any swollen rivers.Residents of Mandera also require assistance as the town's entire water system had been destroyed by the floods after River Dauwa in Ethiopia broke its banks.Mr Mung'ou said toilets had collapsed in the area. Red Cross would from Saturday begin sing a helicopter to reach the distressed in those areas, he said.In Garbatulla, five people who had been missing by the end of the day on Friday were found perched on trees on Saturday. More than 200 livestock have died in the area from the flooding. But the situation is yet to reach the alarming levels, said Mr Mung'ou as the figures of those affected remain below 2,000.Families that had been displaced by the floods in January are however yet to go back to their homes and are still living in camps, he said, meaning more rains in the area would make it worse for them.In Migori, the flood victims who escaped unhurt sought refuge in the homes of relatives and friends as they made plans to rebuild their structures.The region also experienced flash floods on some roads and estates.",1,0,3621,1.5,32,15,3101,880,0

In this area, the river had burst its banks and spilled across the main Beira-Zimbabwe highway between Mafambisse and Tica.As the waters rise, so traffic along this stretch of the road has been gradually shut down.

The INGC has responded by sending emergency teams into the Maputo suburbs, reporting back by radio every 15 minutes.Water invaded many homes, as their residents slept. Frantically, people tried to throw up barricades to divert the waters, or resorted to buckets to remove the water from their bedrooms.Thanks to Maputo's woefully inadequate drainage system, the main roads in the city have become rivers, and driving along them is hazardous. The drainage channels along the road leading to the airport have been unable to cope with such heavy rain, and have overflowed, so that the road is under several centimetres of water.25th September Avenue, the main thoroughfare running through the lowest part of the city, near the port, is completely flooded, and the shops lining the avenue have been inundated.Although, by midday, the intensity of the rain had lessened considerably, it was still falling, and the National Meteorology Institute (INAM) warned that there is a 50 per chance that it will continue raining through Wednesday night.So far it is not clear whether the same level of rain has fallen in rural parts of Maputo province. If so, then it would clearly threaten flooding on the Incomati, Umbeluzi and Maputo rivers.Indeed, the National Water Board warned on Tuesday that the Maputo river was approaching flood alert level, and advised people living nearby to remove pumps or other equipment from its banks, and not to try crossing the swollen river. January 22, 2010: The ongoing heavy-rains spell, believed to be another bout of El-Nino, seems to have this time spared the shores of Lake Balangida in Hanang District.The previous El-Nino spell in 1998 wrecked havoc on residential homes surrounding the lake in the Basotu and Katesh wards of Hanang, causing a mass exodus of people and leading to the total closure of Basotu secondary school.The local ward representative and community worker, Mama Rose Kamili stated: ""It is surprising this time there have been no floods along the lake, despite the fact that rains are falling in torrents here like in many other parts of the country.""In Katesh, the lake has remained calm as of late, with people busy harvesting soda ash, whose caked slates can be seen in a number of sacks dotting the shorelines.Mama Kamili, the area representative through the ruling CCM party, lives near the lake and a few months ago reported that people in the vicinity had started to vacate the areas near Lake Balangida after the Meteorological Department warned of imminent heavy rains that would affect the Nation.Located at the foot of Mount Hanang, Lake Balangida is a lifeline to more than 1000 fishermen and close to 5000 fish mongers and traders, with some coming from as far as Songea in Southern Tanzania and Mwanza around Lake Victoria shores",1,0,3598,1,11,6,3080,871,0

The tourists became trapped after floods and landslides destroyed road and rail links to the famous site. Peru's Cuzco region in the Andes is the worst-hit. Lucre - a village situated next to a river with the same name - was all but washed away earlier this week, the BBC's Dan Collyns reports from the region.

The destroyed homes would cost the government $3.5 million in compensation, said the report produced by the Crisis Management Centre in north Sinai in cooperation with the Cabinet’s Information and Decision Support Centre. The government has promised to give 25,000 Egyptian pounds ($$4,587) compensation to the owners of destroyed homes and 15,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,752) to those whose homes were partially damaged or submerged.

A witness in Gaza who works for a local NGO told IRIN that over 100 families had been made homeless, but warned the number might rise if the rain continued. Some experts told IRIN Gaza's poor infrastructure is unable to cope, and there was a risk that sewage mixed with floodwater could cause communicable and water-borne diseases.

Israel temporarily closed its southern border crossings with Egypt and Jordan, while Jordanians were warned off the streets after nearly a dozen accidents in one area. Rains of this magnitude, which began Sunday night, are rare in this largely arid region and where heavy precipitation can result in sudden and deadly flash floods.

The heavy rains also washed away a dozen mud brick homes in southern Egypt and killed two women there. Scores of families in Aboul-Rish village in Aswan slept overnight outdoors after their homes were destroyed. In the famed monument city of Luxor, just to the north, the bad weather caused power failures in several neighborhoods and disrupted Nile cruises, sailboat and ferry schedules. In neighboring Israel, a woman drowned when her car was caught in a flash flood in the south, where stormy weather also blocked the main road to the Red Sea resort of Eilat. A bridge also collapsed near a cargo crossing between Egypt and Israel. Flooding wiped out large sections of a major road in Egypt's south Sinai and destroyed two dozen homes in Ras Sudr, according to Mohammed Fayez, the head of emergency services. The heavy rains also killed one woman, left 14 missing and damaged the roof of Sharm el-Sheik's old airport, he said. President Hosni Mubarak flew to Sharm el-Sheik and inspected the damage.

January 6, 2010: ""Towns along six flood-swollen rivers in Queensland's central west are battening down as the outback deluge continues. The Landsborough, Thomson, Barcoo, Paroo and Bulloo rivers, as well as Cooper Creek, are on flood alert.However, the Bureau of Meteorology said that any flooding was not at this stage expected to damage homes, although roads would be cut.Hydrologist Jess Carey said the Barcoo River was causing the most concern.""It is peaking downstream from Glenlock, and will peak at Retreat on Wednesday night,"" Mr Carey told AAP.At 6am (AEST), the flood level at Retreat was 8.3 metres and rising.Meanwhile, the Paroo River is expected to peak at Hungerford, near the New South Wales border, tomorrow. The bureau said the river level was 1.7m at 6.30am (AEST), and could rise to the major flood level of 2m.The Thomson River was forecast to swell again at Longreach after peaking in the town on Sunday night. Heavy rainfalls over the past week at Muttaburra, north of the town, were flowing through.At 8am today (AEST), the river was 3.39m on the manual gauge, 1.2m above the old Thomson River Bridge. The river was expected to reach 5.2m, the same level as on Sunday.The floodwaters from the Thomson and Paroo Rivers will flow downstream to Cooper Creek and converge at Windorah on Monday. The township will bear the brunt of the floods, with major flooding expected to exceed 6.5m.Mr Carey said roads could be cut off.""It should just be more traffic disruptions rather than residential inundation,"" January 4, 2010: ""More than 1,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in southeastern Australia Sunday as the worst floodwaters to hit the area in a decade threatened to swamp a remote farming town, officials said.Residents of Coonamble, in central New South Wales, were ordered to leave their homes as the local river threatened to burst its banks, after days of punishing rain unleashed by ex-tropical cyclone Laurence""",1,0,3590,1.5,3,3,3072,868,0

Roads and bridges have been either destroyed or severely damaged, cutting off villagers and leaving them without food or safe water, putting them at risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases. The Kenyan Red Cross  has begun trucking non-food items to Turkana and Nakuru: blankets, jerry cans, mosquito nets, kitchen sets, soap and water treatment tablets. The situation is very serious and has the potential of becoming an environmental disaster. In some areas roads were completely washed away, and according to the National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC), the number of deaths is recorded at 21 people. The area most badly affected by the floods is the North Rift Valley region.In one district, Turkana East, five people died, five bridges were destroyed, many farms and households were damaged, while hundreds of head of livestock perished. The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) chief of emergency, told IRIN: “We are concerned about recurrences of watery diarrhoea and cholera in Lokori, East Turkana.

The bridge carried the Central Line across River Mkondoa, which burst its banks following heavy rains lasting several days.He said the floods had destroyed three more bridges elsewhere, adding that the line had been damaged at 16 spots along the 293km stretch between Dar es Salaam and Kilosa.""The damage in all these places is severe, and major repairs are needed to normalise the situation,"" Mr Chambo said.About Sh4 billion is needed to repair the line, according to initial estimates, and the ministry has sent experts to assess the damage.Mr Chambo said the biggest task the experts and Tanzania Railways Limited (TRL) technicians were facing was restoring the natural course of River Mkondoa to allow the reconstruction of the destroyed bridge.This is the second time the Dar es Salaam-Dodoma section of the Central Line has been closed.The defunct Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) closed it for more than a year in 2006 before it was reopened in October 2007 by TRL, which took over TRC's operations three years ago.Passengers travelling between Dar es Salaam and the upcountry destinations of Mwanza and Kigoma had to make Dar es Salaam-Dodoma part of the journey by bus due to the closure.The TRL management has been grappling with liquidity problems and frequent strikes since taking over the running of the struggling railway firm.Mr Chambo also inspected the Morogoro-Kilosa road, which has been closed temporarily after floods rendered it impassable.The worst affected section is near Kimamba Township, where a bridge has been swept away, and several kilometres of the road flooded.Mr Chambo said waiting for the floodwaters to recede was the only option for both the government and people using the road.""We can't do anything at the moment because the entire area, including the road, is under water. We should wait for water levels to recede before repairs can begin.""Mr Chambo said a study had established the need for the road to be raised in the flood-prone area to make it passable at all times.He added, however, that the government was giving priority to repairs so that the road could be reopened as soon as possible.Meanwhile, over 400 people sleep in the open in Kilosa District due to lack of space in camps set up for people displaced by floods.A local government leader, Mr Zidadu Masanza, said 477 people were sleeping under trees because the camps were ""full to the brim""""We have no accommodation and as a result, men and a few children sleep in the open in biting cold,""he said.Most of those affected are from Mkondoa Village where dozens of houses have been destroyed by floodwaters that were several feet deep in some places.Mr Masanza said the number of tents provided so far was not enough, adding that displaced people were arriving at the camps in significant numbers daily.""Apart from tents, these people need other forms of relief such as food, bednets and medicines,"" he said.A total of 609 people, including 315 children, have been displaced by floodwaters that gushed through villages after River Mkondoa burst its banks last week.The relief coordinator at a camp in Kisiki Ward, Mr Mganga Msakuzi, said the floods had displaced 56 families in the area, adding that 70 people were sleeping in the open for lack of tents.Mr Msakuzi said criminals were taking advantage of the situation to steal from victims at night, and appealed for security in camps to be stepped upJanuary 5, 2010: ""The TMA said northern coastal regions like Dar es Salaam, Tanga as well as Zanzibar and Pemba islands would get normal to above normal rains, as will areas around Mount Kilimanjaro.The current Pacific build-up looks like a mild version of El Ni-o which has in the past devastated the globe, according to the United Nations weather agency.The TMA warning has come at a time when thousands of people in the country have been displaced by flash floods which have hit their districts.The most affected is Kilosa District in Morogoro Region where three people have died and more than 23,000 people have been displaced after their houses were either destroyed or surrounded by flood waters.The floods have also hit Kongwa District in Dodoma Region, parts of Ruvuma Region and Same District in Kilimanjaro Region.The Government, Red Cross Society and other organisations as well as individuals, including the MP for Kilosa, Mr Mustafa Mkulo, have been pouring in assistance to the victims, most of whom have been left without a roof over their heads.The Prime Minister's office had dispatched 42 tonnes of maize, and two trucks full of 1,000 blankets, 1,000 tents, rice, bed nets and milk for the flood victims in Kilosa.The Government has been forced to step up efforts to evict people from dangerous areas as some have been reluctant to leave their houses, despite the danger of being swept by the floods.The Morogoro regional commissioner, Mr Issa Machibya, announced that a decision was reached to temporarily turn all ward secondary schools into relief centres to accommodate and assist the victims.He had told our reporter in Kilosa that the regional administration had dispatched some assistance to the flood victims"" December 28, 2009: ""Heavy rains that pounded Dodoma and Morogoro regions during Christmas holidays left thousands of people homeless.The rains began on Christmas Day, and continued well into Boxing Day, bringing misery to hundreds of families in Kongwa and Kilosa districts in Dodoma and Morogoro regions, respectively.Thousands of people were forced to seek shelter elsewhere after their house were either swept away or flooded after a downpour lasting several hours.Flooding in Kongwa killed at least one person, whose body was found floating in a swollen river on Saturday.

Willers and his wife Bridie, a Fine Gael county councillor, began the clean-up as soon as the water level dropped below the house’s front door.The sodden floorboards near the front were the first to go — water had seeped up through them “like a scene from Titanic”.

Engineers are trying to assess bridges for structural damage, though the work is difficult while the waters remain high, police said.Witnesses said the nearby town of Keswick, about 10 miles to the southeast of Cockermouth, was also badly hit.The Fire Service and Royal Air Force evacuated about 200 people by helicopter from Cockermouth's main street and town square, both cut off by the floodwaters, Cumbria police said.Police advised against all non-essential travel in Cumbria because many roads are closed and impassable.Several reception centers were set up at schools and leisure centers for residents forced from their homes, the police said.British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke with Cumbria's chief constable Friday morning and promised him any government help he needs, Brown's office at Downing Street said.""His thoughts are with all those who have been impacted by the floods and our thanks go to the emergency services, who continue their extraordinary efforts to help those affected,"" a statement from his office said.Environment Secretary Hilary Benn was in Cumbria on Friday to assess a government response, Downing Street said.There were no deaths reported from the floods, which began Thursday after heavy rain swept over the region.One of the largest recorded totals was in Seathwaite, about 20 miles south of Cockermouth, known for being one of the wettest places in the United Kingdom. About 14.6 inches (372 millimeters) of rain fell there between Wednesday night and 4 a.m. Friday (11 p.m. ET Thursday), said forecaster Robin Thwaytes of the Met Office weather service.""It's a phenomenal amount of rain to come down in such a short period of time,"" he said.Bad weather was forecast to continue across the United Kingdom over the next few days, with more heavy rain and gale-force winds bringing the continued risk of flooding, the Met Office said...""Raging floods engulfed northern England's picturesque Lake District on Friday following the heaviest rainfall ever recorded in Britain, killing a police officer and trapping dozens in their swamped homes.Military helicopters winched dozens of people to safety and emergency workers in bright orange inflatable boats rescued scores more after an unprecedented deluge.British soldiers conducted house-to-house searches for those trapped by floods as deep as 8 feet (2.5 meters).

The World Health Organisation says 1.43 million people, mostly in and around Manila, continue to endure a dangerous existence living in flooded districts.Those areas may remain flooded for months because chaotic urban planning has led to natural drainage systems along lakes being blocked. Already 175 people have died in those areas from leptospirosis, a bacterial disease that is contracted from contact with flood waters contaminated with rat and cat urine.""The solution is to get them out of these places,"" Art Pesigan, an official with the WHO's emergency and humanitarian action unit, told AFP, referring to those living in the flood waters. Another 163,000 people who lost their homes in the disasters remain in evacuation centres, according to the government, with few options but to stay there and rely on handouts.The government, which has repeatedly said it is not able to cope with the twin disasters on its own, has appealed for international help. But although foreign governments and international aid agencies have provided crucial aid, less than a third of a UN appeal for $74 million has been raised.Amid the immediate relief concerns, the government is also having to grapple with longer-term reconstruction efforts. One of the main concerns is that too many people, particularly slum dwellers, in Manila have been allowed to live in flood-prone areas.A government report last week called for 2.7 million people in shantytowns to be moved from ""danger zones"" alongside riverbanks, lakes and sewers. The plan would affect one in five Manila residents and take 10 years and P130 billion ($2.77 billion) to implement.

In some areas, the floodwaters have not receded.This has caused many people to fall ill of leptospirosis, an infectious disease caused by exposure to dirty, stagnant water.To lessen the incidence of the disease, Duque said authorities had declared an outbreak of the disease in three districts of the capital and were administering antibiotics to some 1.3 million people.""It will provide substantial protection,"" he said.

Some had scrawled giant SOS messages on bits of broken timber — one or two with estimates of the number of dead beneath the mudslides.Added to the misery has been mounting condemnation of the handling of the disaster by the authorities. Newspaper editorials accused Taiwan’s president, Ma Ying-jeou of being incompetent, and carried reports of survivors digging, unaided, in search of loved ones. One survivor said: “We are forgotten.”Much of the anger is directed at the Government’s failure to seek foreign assistance from countries such as Japan or the United States, a reluctance thought to be born of stubborn pride.Mr Ma's inspection of the relief efforts was interrupted when he was surrounded by a group of enraged survivors. “What is your Government doing?” one man shouted at the President. “It’s too late, they cannot be saved.”Thousands have been found alive in remote mountain villages — including another group of 300 discovered stranded this morning — but reaching them is difficult. Even helicopter airlifts have been hampered by the bad weather, with the number of evacuations lower than expected.Estimates vary wildly over how many people might still be alive, and, more grimly, how many may lie crushed under thousands of tonnes of collapsed mountainside. The official toll stands at 108, though there is a strong suspicion among rescue workers that the figure could triple as the search goes on.The Government sent another 4,000 troops to join the 16,000 already deployed throughout the flood-stricken disaster zone. Liao Liao-yi, the Interior Minister, spent the day denying suggestions that the relief effort had been lacklustre, assuring reporters that the pace had picked up from yesterday.To those waiting at the heliports on the edge of the disaster zone, however, progress again felt painfully slow. Bridges have been obliterated and many roads have either been buried under landslides or smashed off the mountains. In the area around Taoyuan, the authorities warned that other flood-lakes could burst at any moment.None of this has calmed the anger of the villagers waiting impatiently for news of their families. Many in the worst-hit area of Kaohsiung county believe that the south, which is the main stronghold of the opposition party, is being deliberately starved of assistance.“It’s too slow. They don’t care about the south. They just care about the north,” Chen Fu-rong, a funeral director, told reporters. ""8/12/09: ""Taiwan scrambles to rescue 700 in landslide villages as death toll hits 66CHISHAN, Taiwan: Taiwan Wednesday began airlifting to safety more than 700 people found alive in a trio of villages flattened by muddy landslides, as the island's death toll from Typhoon Morakot hit 66.The military launched the helicopter operation in the battered island's south after the region was hit by its worst flooding in half a century, inundating  entire villages in water and mud and cutting off all access by road.We have found around 700 people alive in three villages last night and 26 more this morning.

""I hope the military can speed up their search and rescue.""Authorities Wednesday said Typhoon Morakot, which also killed eight people in eastern China, had left at least 66 people dead in Taiwan.The toll included three rescuers who died when their helicopter crashed into a river in heavy fog in the southern county of Pingtung on Tuesday.“Their bodies have been found and we are working to transport the bodies from the crash site,"" a policeman told reporters.Another 61 people are missing in Taiwan and 35 others injured."" 11-Aug-09: ""Rescuers descended on a mountain village struck by a typhoon-spawned mudslide that killed at least 38 people and led to fears that many more could be unaccounted for, in a fifth day of deadly storm devastation across eastern Asia.The mudslide brought to more than 70 the number of confirmed deaths in recent days as typhoons ravaged Taiwan, mainland China, Japan and the Philippines.

The typhoon, now downgraded to a tropical storm, earlier struck the Philippines, leaving at least 22 dead.A separate typhoon, Etau, slammed into Japan's west coast on Monday. At least 12 people were killed in raging floodwaters and landslides, and 10 others were missing, police said.

While water levels have receded somewhat in recent days, showers continued through the weekend. That further complicated the timeline for the drenched areas to dry out and for residents to return to their homes. With only marginal assistance arriving from the federal government, local authorities in some of Brazil’s poorest states say they are at the breaking point. “The water level is not dropping fast enough,” said Jânio de Sousa Freitas, the mayor of Trizidela do Vale, one of the worst-hit towns. “We are facing a critical situation. We don’t have the resources to cope with the heavy demand for basic goods, from food to medicines to mattresses.”The flooding, which began in April, has been the third-worst in the past 49 years, based on the amount of rainfall in a single month, said Lincoln Muniz Alves, a climatologist in São Paulo for the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies.It is the second time in six months that intense flooding has turned into a regional disaster. In November, torrential rains in Santa Catarina, in the south, caused landslides that left 135 people dead and swept more than 78,000 from their homes, affecting some 60 towns.“What we are observing in the last few years in Brazil is a pattern of droughts and more intense rains,” said Carlos Nobre, a climatologist in São Paulo at the National Institute of Space Research.Colder temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, which climatologists have called the La Niña effect, are colliding with warmer temperatures in the tropical southern Atlantic Ocean, one possible explanation for the extreme weather patterns, he said.Heavy rains continue to force more people from their homes.

""""May 14:Thousands of Brazilians returned home yesterday following devastating floods but water kept on rising in some places and civil defence officials used helicopters, trucks and boats to deliver aid to victims in isolated communities.The death toll dropped from 42 to 39. The number of homeless decreased from 300,000 to 267,000 as residents headed home in some of the 11 states affected by the floods - an area more than five times the size of New Zealand. But waters were still rising in some places and authorities warned that the situation remained a threat because the weather forecast calls for more downpours.A major aid effort was still under way, with civil defence officials delivering food and drinking water to isolated communities surrounded by muddy water and newly formed lakes.Flood victims gathered around helicopters dropping off aid in the hard-hit state of Maranhao, and Globo TV showed images of people living on the roofs of homes inundated with water because they feared looters would strike if they headed to shelters.Rain was still falling in some parts of the zone stretching from the Amazon to normally dry northeastern Brazil, which has experienced its worst flooding in at least two decades. Meteorologists have blamed the rainfall that led to the floods on an Atlantic Ocean weather system that usually moves on in March but didn't budge this year.Water was still rising yesterday in sprawling Amazonas state, and low-lying parts of the jungle city of Manaus were flooding as the mighty Rio Negro river that feeds the Amazon approached a record set in 1953.""
